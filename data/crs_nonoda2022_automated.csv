Description: The impact of climate change on mosquito-borne diseases are highly uncertain and will vary regionally as people and mosquitoes adjust in different ways. Estimates of how climate influences mosquitoes' ability to spread disease are scarce, with experiments typically conducted in artificial environments with inbred-laboratory strains. High-quality entomological data from disease endemic areas will be essential to produce meaningful future projections. This project proposes to develop a flexible user-friendly interface to allow policymakers, stakeholders and researchers to explore the epidemiological consequences of the changing environment. The tool will empower primary data collection by translating user defined estimates of how mosquito bionomics may change over time into disease projections in their local environment given existing and future control interventions. Users can also input projections of disease burden from statistical models and investigate the public health measures needed to mitigate the effects of climate change. The project will focus on malaria and the arboviruses dengue, zika and chikungunya. It will build on the existing malaria interface (https://mint.dide.ic.ac.uk/) to include climate sensitive mosquito bionomics inside established disease-specific mechanistic models. Situations ranging from disease introduction to increasing mosquito abundance will be explored to allow future scenario planning including economic evaluations across spatial scales.","3.b,3.3,17,13.1","",0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,2,,2022-07-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Adaptation

Description: The frequency and scale of extreme hydro-meteorological events (heavy rainfall, storms, floods, drought) is predicted to increase due to climate change. These events, of which flooding is the deadliest, disproportionately affect those in low socio-economic groups in low- and middle-income countries. In Southern Malawi, the geographical focus of this proposal, the most recent flooding event (Jan 2022) resulted in one million people requiring humanitarian assistance, displacing approximately 200,000 people, and devastating vital infrastructure. Flooding is known to also impact vector-borne diseases exposure, however, the nature of this relationship is understudied, and there is a lack of guidance on how to use this association to guide risk mitigation activities. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop an enhanced vector-borne disease digital surveillance platform for forecasting transmission risk in areas vulnerable to extreme hydro-meteorological events. Using a spatio-temporal statistical modelling framework to gain insights into how flooding affects malaria within Southern Malawi, we will work closely with key governmental and humanitarian agencies in Malawi to design a user-centric, sustainable, and scalable digital platform to demonstrate how risk information can be used to guide both proactive and responsive vector-borne disease control policy and practice in flood-prone areas.","3.b,3.3,17,13.1,10.7",#IDPs_HostCommunities,0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,2,,2022-07-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Adaptation

Basic Health,32000,Networks,EcoHealth Alliance,32000,"",,"",,,"Programme: Digital Technology Development Award in Climate Sensitive Infectious Disease Modelling. Description: Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a complex disease with devastating public health and economic costs. It is transmitted directly from livestock to people and is maintained via mosquito transmission in livestock populations. As a zoonotic disease with a vector component, outbreaks of RVF are tightly linked to climatic and environmental conditions. Statistical modeling approaches have been developed to forecast RVF in Africa, but performance has been inconsistent across regions, with higher predictive accuracy in East Africa than in Southern Africa. Current continent-wide models, which use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to predict RVF activity, do not capture local attributes, such as livestock density and land cover, which may explain differing performance. We have assembled a team that includes local South Africa (RSA) government stakeholders, and co-created a tool for RSA that builds on previous work to create an RVF Early Warning System for RSA. Our goal is to package this new, open, locally customizable tool developed for RSA for deployment to other impacted regions. The intent is that end-users (farmers, farmer associations, others) would be forewarned when to vaccinate their livestock against RVF, a month to three months in advance of potential RVF activity.","3.b,3.3,17,13.1","",0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,2,,2022-07-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Adaptation

Description: Increases in frequency of severe weather events are a hallmark of climate change and impact the effectiveness of malaria control programs. Mozambique is already experiencing these and does not have the capacity to respond to the infectious disease challenges that co-occur. Digital technology will be used to integrate climate and malaria data to identify areas at risk of malaria in the aftermath of severe weather in a much more comprehensive manner. A time-series model will be used to determine geographic areas of increased malaria risk following severe weather. This will provide the basis of a software platform to quantify and visualize these areas for delivery of malaria control measures. The overall objective is to improve the response to malaria risk, increase the efficiency of control programs, and decrease morbidity and mortality. The specific goals are to: 1)create a time-series model that determines geographic areas of increased malaria risk due to severe weather events in Mozambique, 2)develop and pilot a software platform that predicts geographic areas of high risk following severe weather, and 3)integrate this platform into the Mozambique malaria control and disaster management programs.

Basic Health,51000,"University, college or other teaching institution, research institute or think-tank","University of California, Davis",51000,"",,"",,,"Programme: Digital Technology Development Award in Climate Sensitive Infectious Disease Modelling. Description: Arenaviruses are featured in the World Health Organization's list of priority diseases with specific concerns around endemic arenavirus infections in Africa and emerging arenavirus threats in South America. The risk of these zoonotic viruses is driven by the distribution and ecology of their rodent reservoir species which are highly sensitive to landscape changes. In the coming years, our changing climate could impact the risk of arenavirus spillover from rodents through various mechanisms such as drought, frequency of fires, and adaptive agricultural practices. We aim to develop climate-sensitive models for individual arenaviruses by closely collaborating with regional public health experts to create a pipeline of validated data that feeds into predictive models. Models will be based on reservoir rodent distribution, human cases, and bioclimatic factors that influence the ecology of arenaviruses will be also used to predict future risk based on specific emission scenarios and projected local climate data (2.6/4.5/6.0 IPCC-GISS). Furthermore, models will be presented on an online platform for public and policy analysts to explore with clear validation around model uncertainties. The tool will also become a resource for researchers as a centralized database and knowledge center for arenaviruses in addition to a home for predictive scenario-based modeling activities.","3.b,3.3,17,13.1","",0,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,2,,2022-07-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Adaptation

Description: Program description: University of Cambridge, along with Makerere University, University of Cape Town (both existing Scholars Program partners) and the University of Ghana, are coming together as founding partners of the Higher Education Climate Resilience and Sustainability Collaborative. Cambridge is a global leader in climate resilience and social innovation and will support the work of the Collaborative through its deep expertise, networks and convening power.Objectives:1. Create educational opportunities through an interdisciplinary, climate resilience and sustainability themed Scholars Program at Cambridge: support at least 1,025 young people to develop the knowledge and capabilities to pursue careers that drive climate resilience and sustainability. This includes: 500 in-person Master's degrees at Cambridge, at least 25 PhDs as a contribution from Cambridge (likely to be 50 PhDs funded by Cambridge), and 500 online programs (including diploma, degree and certificate programs). Scholars will accelerate their transition to meaningful green jobs on the continent through participation in a new pan-continental forum for African Sustainable Change Leaders, which will be based at the Collaborative's African anchor institutions following graduation.2. Strengthen African Regional Centres of Excellence at anchor institutions in the Collaborative: leverage the expertise and institutional resources of Cambridge to co-create new interdisciplinary degree programs with African institutions, co-create the pan-continental forum for African Sustainable Change Leaders to reach and equip more than 4,000 young people, support African institutions to build platforms and infrastructure for data collection and analysis, and, support their entrepreneurial ecosystems to enable the launch and growth of 200 ventures focused on climate resilience and sustainability.3. Cultivate networks, transform policy, and facilitate learning in Africa to enable sustainable ecosystem impact: leverage existing networks to create a 'network of networks' - the African Climate Resilience and Sustainability Network – to build a critical mass and coordinated effort of researchers, scientists, and policymakers. Through this Network, convene 40 research and teaching capacity enhancement workshops with 800 participants and develop at least 300 research collaborations to foster South-South collaboration within the continent. This includes supporting the anchor institutions in the Collaborative to incorporate youth voice into research agendas for green economies.","8.6,4.b,4.4,4.3,13.1,10.2,10.1","",0,,,,,,,0,1,,,,0,0,2,,2022-07-27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Adaptation

Sub-programme: Young Africa Works Kenya. Description: The commercialization of DTC technologies aligns well the the Mastercard Foundation's country strategy under agriculture, of strengthened, inclusive , resilient and sustainable market ecosystems with a key focus of enabling opportunities for young people to actively and gainfully be engaged along the various nodes of the value chain hence contributing to various outcomes including enhanced performance of Ag businesses particularly those owned by young women and men, increased entrepreneurship opportunities for young people, within Ag-value chains , enhanced control of Ag-resources by young men and women and others.Africa Harvest and other partners, such as ICRISAT,KALRO, Egerton University and County governments, have previously implemented projects in Arid and Semi-Arid lands (ASALs) of Kenya that developed, validated and promoted Drought Tolerant Crop (DTC) technologies which underpin the food, nutritional and income security of many people inhabiting,, the semi-arid agro ecologies . The proposed project will scale the use of DTC technologies to catalyse the creation of 120,000 dignified, sustainable and fulfilling work for youth (70% young women & 30% young men. With the increasing negative effects of climate change to farm families manifested through prolonged periods of drought, erratic rainfall patterns and pests and diseases, the proposed project ,will,,build resilience of food systems to withstand shocks of an extended or unexpected drought as a result of climate change. The targets sets above, will be achieved through activities designed around 3 main components namely, (1) Production and marketing of improved DTC seeds for 3 cereals and 3 legumes (2) Cereal and legume grain production, productivity, and quality enhancement and (3)Value addition, product development market, and finance access. ,Overall enterprise development will be a cross-cutting issue in the 3 components of the project for supported enterprises to create more employment, increase income, and to enhance sustainability. These core components will be supported by a number of enablers that include, IT-based integration for E-learning and digital platforms and advisories, Financial inclusion, Enterprise development and training, Communication and Knowledge management, Monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL), Public-Private Partnerships and policy. To achieve the 70% gender target, the project,will be a deliberate, consultative, and inclusive approach to mobilizing Young women to join the initiative and form common interest groups for collective effort and sharing of duties.,A sound gender framework is critical to enabling the project to take into perspective the concerns and specific needs of intended beneficiaries.

Energy-poor countries today account for only 25% of global CO2 emissions, but this could rise to 75% by 2050 unless they receive support for clean energy development. Yet these countries only receive 13% of clean energy financing. Accomplishing long-term progress in these areas requires a historic partnership. The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) brings a new approach to alleviate energy poverty within a green energy transition, piloting new and innovative policies, finance, and other approaches that can be applied at scale across the developing world and beyond. As an anchor partner, along with the Rockefeller and Ikea Foundations, the Bezos Earth Fund is supporting efforts to speed up an equitable energy transition with developing countries around the world, from demand aggregation for renewable technologies in Nigeria to metro grid deployments in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to a just transition from coal in South Africa's Mpumalanga province. Over the last decade, significant technological breakthroughs have made renewables the cheapest option for new power in more than two-thirds of the world. For the first time in history, we can reliably and affordably empower those without electricity access. The Alliance is helping countries seize this opportunity to transform our energy system.

Among the latter, 16 of them form Metropolitan Lagos. Metropolitan Lagos is one of the worlds largest cities with a population estimated at approximately 17 million. The population is highly mobile and largely reliant upon public transport, however, the lack of an organized public transport network has led to inefficiencies in its provision and a low level of service to those who use it. Existing public transport has been widely described as chaotic, inefficient, expensive, low quality and dangerous both in terms of road traffic accidents and personal safety.  The proposed project involves a strategic engagement with Lagos State to support the development of two Quality Bus Corridors (QBC) (the Project). The development of the two QBCs will cost approximately US$50 million. IFCs proposed investment will be an A loan of the Nigerian naira (NGN) equivalent of up to US$50 million. The QBCs are part of the Lagos State Transport Master Plan Project (LSTMPP), an ambitious city-wide reform of the public transportation services in Lagos, which was developed in part with financing from the World Bank, and, some of which is being implemented by the Lagos Metropolitan Transport Authority (LAMATA). LAMATA is the transport planning, implementing, regulating and franchising authority of the Lagos State Government.  The two QBCs identified for IFC financing are: Command  Abule Egba (6 km) and Ile Ile  Ile Epo (4.3 km), both along existing road networks. The project activities will include road infrastructure improvement, rehabilitation of pedestrian walkways to improve walking conditions and accessibility to public transport services, rehabilitation of drainage, improvements of road junctions, provision of dedicated lanes for public transportation buses and construction of a new bus terminal for each QBC (a hub passenger pick up and drop off) and installation of a number of additional bus stops/ flags at each QBC. Buses will be sheltered, maintained and refueled at a bus depot (one of up to four that will be set up as part of the LSTMPP 1 to serve all the QBCs).  There is a combined population of around 292,000 persons within a radius of 400 meters around these two corridors and about 10,400 passengers pass through them per hour during peak hours. Considering 75% of this passenger traffic is with public transportation, developing these QBCs will help reduce travel times and improve road safety. The project will support improved access to jobs and services, while achieving environmental objectives of reducing air pollution and carbon emissions.     Pre-feasibility studies for both the QBCs have been completed. It is anticipated that detailed project design and relevant environmental and social studies, including a project specific Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), will be completed by the last quart","","",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-12-31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"","",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,Mitigation
