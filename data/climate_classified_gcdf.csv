58547,"China Eximbank agrees in principle to provide $488.7 million buyer’s credit loan for Glo Djigbé International Airport Construction Project Between March 22 and 24, 2019, China Eximbank sent a pre-loan investigation group to Benin. The group's main objective was to continue financial negotiations with the Government of Benin regarding the Glo Djigbé International Airport Construction Project. According to the Government of Benin's 2019 Bond Prospectus, China Eximbank was expected to provide a loan to the Government of Benin for the airport project (p. 69). According to a 2019 YCIH Report, the purpose of the China Eximbank loan was to cover 70% of the total project cost (p. 4). The total project cost is unclear.  The Government of Benin’s 2019 Bond Prospectus puts it at $964 million, but its 2021 Bond Prospectus puts it at 600 million. Another Government of Benin source claims that the the total cost of the project is $705.7  million, with the Government of Benin contributing $217  million  and  China Eximbank financing the remainder ($488.7 million). Yunnan Construction and Investment Holding (YCIH) , a private company, is expected to create a joint venture to operate this airport and sign a design-build-finance-operate-maintain (DBFOM) concession agreement with the Ministry of Finance of Benin.  The purpose of this project is to construct a new international airport in Glo Djigbé and replace the Cardinal-Bernardin-Gantin Airport. A 40 km expressway will also be built as part of the project. The expressway will connect the airport to the fishing road with, at Cocotomey, a crossing of the national interstate road 1 going from the Togolese border to the Nigerian border via Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Ouidah.  China Airport Construction Group Corporation (CACC) (state-owned enterprise), Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), and Yunnan Construction and Investment Holding (YCIH) (private) are expected to complete the EPC works. ADP Group (Aéroport de Paris Ingénierie) is expected supervise the EPC work. Preliminary (pre-construction) works commenced on March 10, 2017. Construction was originally expected to begin in 2019 and end in 2022. China Eximbank reportedly authorized the loan for the project on May 18, 2021 China Eximbank officials conducted an on-site inspection in March 2022. However, later in 2022, the Government of Benin decided to postpone works on Glo Djigbé to prioritize Cotonou Airport. 1. The Chinese project title is 贝宁格鲁-吉贝新国际机场项目 or 贝宁新国际机场项目 or 宁格鲁·吉贝新国际机场项目.

96034,"CPFHK provides $840 million loan for Benin Section of Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#58435) On January 23, 2019, the State of Niger and the Republic of Benin signed a bilateral agreement on the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project. Then, on August 5, 2019, the Republic of Benin entrusted the financing, construction, and operation of the Benin section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline to a special purpose vehicle known as the West African Oil Pipeline (Bénin) Company S.A. [WAPCO Bénin or 西非原油管道（贝宁）股份有限公司 in Chinese]. The total cost of the Benin Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project is $1.05 billion (CFAF 608 billion) and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. CNPC Finance (HK) Limited (CPFHK) — a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — issued a loan worth an estimated $840 million to WAPCO Bénin for the Benin Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project. The loan’s estimated interest rate is 8.05%. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.  The purpose of the project is to construct the 675 km Benin section of the 1,980 km Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline, which connects Niger's Agadem Rift Basin to the Port of Sèmè export terminal in the town of Sèmè-Kpodji. The Benin section of the pipeline consists of a 660 km overland subsection and a 15 km underwater subsection. The project scope also includes the construction of two pumping stations — one in Gogounou and the other in Tchatchou. Upon completion, the pipeline is expected to have a capacity of 90,000 barrels per day (bpd). The Government of Benin expects to receive $884.6 million in transit fees during the pipeline’s period of operation and $109 million in tax revenues (VAT and other fees and taxes). The construction of the pipeline is also expected to generate additional traffic to the Port of Cotonou in Benin. The port is expected to process up to 300,000 tons of goods once the pipeline becomes operational.  China Petroleum Planning and Engineering Institute (CPPEI) and the China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CPPE) are the contractors responsible for project implementation. The project was originally scheduled to commence on March 15, 2020. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, construction did not begin until May 20, 2021. The pipeline was originally scheduled for completion in January 2022. On October 14, 2022, Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN referred to the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project as ‘an integral part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.’ The Niger section of the project had achieved a 30% completion rate as of October 2022 (see Project ID#58435). 1. The CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan is not captured in the Chinese Loans to Africa Database developed by SAIS-CARI and maintained by the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University.2. The face value of the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan is unknown. However, given that the total cost of the Benin Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project is $1.05 billion and CNPC Finance (HK) Limited agreed to finance 80% of the project cost with debt, AidData assumes that the face value of the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan was roughly equivalent to $840 million. This issue warrants further investigation. Further research is also needed to determine if the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited was supported by any credit enhancements.3.

A feasibility study for the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project — undertaken by the China Petroleum Planning and Engineering Institute (CPPEI) and the China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CPPE) — recommended that CPFHK lend at an interest rate between 7.9% and 8.2%. As such, AidData has estimated the loan’s interest rate by taking the midpoint of this range (8.05%).6. The precise financial commitment (loan signing) date is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes a commitment year of 2020 since this was the first year of project implementation.7.

96201,"CBE makes RMB 18 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2021 On December 6, 2016, as part of a bilateral financing package required ahead of the approval of an IMF loan, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 18 billion (EGP 47 billion), three-year bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Egypt. Then, on February 10, 2020, the RMB 18 billion (EGP 41 billion) currency swap agreement was renewed for another three years.  In early 2017, the CBE made a (gross) drawdown under the currency swap agreement equivalent RMB 18 billion. The PBOC credited RMB 18 billion to the CBE's account held with PBOC, and the CBE credited PBOC's account held with CBE with the EGP equivalent (49,249,800,000) of RMB 18 billion, based on the RMB-EGP exchange rate of 1:2.7361 at that time. The borrowing (drawdown) carried an estimated maturity of 1 year and an unknown interest rates (based on SHIBOR plus a margin). According to CBE, it made four additional (gross) drawdowns under the PBOC currency swap agreement: an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2018, an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2019, an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2020, and an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2021. These borrowings (drawdowns) also carried estimated maturities of 1 year and unknown interest rates (based on SHIBOR plus a margin).  The CBE’s 2017 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89406. Its 2018 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89408. Its 2019 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89410. Its 2020 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96200.  Its 2021 drawdown is captured here. The (principal) amount outstanding under CBE’s PBOC swap facility was RMB 0 in 2016, RMB 18 billion in 2017, RMB 18 billion in 2018, RMB 18 billion in 2019, RMB 18 billion in 2020, and RMB 18 billion in 2021. 1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made. 3. CBE’s currency swap with the PBOC is classified as ‘short term debt’ in the Government of Egypt’s 2020 bond prospectus and in various CBE reports. CBE defines short-term debt as debt ‘with [an] original maturity of up to one year,’ so AidData has coded the maturity length as 1 year for the time being. A paper prepared by the Central Bank of Egypt indicates the 'withdrawal and utilization' period to be up to one year in the currency swap (see https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf). However, the precise term (maturity length) of the swap agreement is unknown. This issue requires further investigation. 4. The interest rate that applied to CBE’s RMB 18 billion drawdown is unknown, but it was very likely SHIBOR plus a margin (see https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx). This issue requires further investigation. 5. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 6. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.",False,0.12315019

In November 2005, Zimbabwe’s Vice President Joice Mujuru and Water Resources and Infrastructure Development Minister Munacho Mutezo signed an agreement with China Jiangxi International Economic and Technical Cooperation Co., Ltd (CJIC). CJIC agreed in principal to build the Kunzvi Dam and provide irrigation equipment to boost food security in exchange for mineral concessions; however, the project did not move forward, leaving many urban areas without regular water supply. Then, in 2013, Kunzvi Water Development Corporation — a special purpose vehicle — was appointed to implement the project on a build, own, operate, and transfer (BOOT) basis. At that time, Vinci of France and Group Five of South Africa were announced as the major project contractors. However, after the project stalled again, the Government of Zimbabwe signed an RMB 3.962 billion ($680 million) commercial (EPC) contract with Power China International (中国电建国际公司) for Phase 1 of the Kunzwi Dam Project on July 28, 2016. Then, in November 2016, Sinohydro was appointed to implement the first phase of the project on a build, own, operate, and transfer (BOOT) basis.    In a 2018 meeting in Beijing with President Mnangagwa, President Xi Jinping, pledged financial support for the Kunzvi Dam Project. During the same year, President Mnangagwa announced that he had secured funding for the project. A feasibility study was undertaken in 2019. The project was also allocated $259 million by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in the 2020 National Budget. However, in 2020, reports emerged that the Government of Zimbabwe had failed to pay both the loan management/commitment fees and Sinosure credit insurance premium needed to facilitate the implementation of the project. This outcome ‘greatly frustrated’ Sinosure. Then, in 2021, a new tendering process was initiated by the Government of Zimbabwe and China Nanchang Engineering (Pvt) Ltd was awarded a $109 million contract to build the dam on a build, operate and transfer (BOT) basis. In August 2021, China Daily — an English-language daily newspaper owned by the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party — reported that '[t]he dam is being built through a loan from China.' During the same month, Taurai Maurikira, the chief executive of the Zimbabwe National Water Authority, told a local newspaper (Sunday Mail) that following a recent site handover, China Nanchang Engineering (Pvt) Ltd had moved on site to start work on the water reservoir. An official project commencement ceremony took place in December 2021. The project was, at that time, expected to reach completion by January 2024.

The purpose of this project is to upgrade an 84 km, two-way single carriageway from Kenos to Marua (via Sagana). The road starts at Kenol town and traverses through the trading centres of Makutano, Sagana, and Karatina before terminating at Marua. This 84 km road is the Kenyan section of the larger Trans-Africa Highway (TAH4), which runs from Cairo to Capetown via Nairobi and Moyale. The existing 84 km road is a single carriageway of bitumen standard. The civil works include construction of five bridges, drainage structures, two grade separated junctions, foot over bridges, installation of road safety features, environmental and social mitigation measures, and social complementary activities.   The project involves the upgrading of a dual carriageway consisting of four lanes (two lanes each of 3.5m width on either side separated by median Island) with 2m shoulder on the outer side and 1m shoulder on the inner side. In addition the works will involve the construction of grade separated junctions (interchanges) at the junction with B24 (Makuatano) and B21 (Marua), construction of new bridges, box culverts, pipe culverts and foot bridges. For local traffic on the major town centers along the project road, the works will incorporate construction of service roads. The new pavement construction shall include: asphalt concrete surfacing (50mm) throughout the main carriageway, with 150mm Dense Bitumen Macadam Base, 150mm cement or lime improved gravel sub-base, and a variable thickness of natural material improved subgrade, Road pavement width 7.0m, with shoulders of 2m wide on the outer and 1m wide on the inner side and Single seal surface treatment to main carriageway.The design of the roadworks is as per the road design manuals considering environmental, social and safety issues.

The Kenol –Sagana–Marua Road The project road also links the Capital City Nairobi to some of the major commercially and agriculturally rich Mt Kenya region as well as to Ethiopia through the Moyale border. 4. The AfDB provides the following summary of its EIRR analysis: ‘The economic analysis was carried out using Highway Development and Management model (HDM-4, version 2.1) based on a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) methodology between “with the project” and “without the project” scenarios over a 20-year period. A 12% discount rate and a 20% residual value (assigned to the Project in the final year of analysis) were used. The costs taken into consideration include investment costs net of taxes inclusive of construction and maintenance costs at 2019 prices. For the economic analysis, these financial costs were converted into economic costs by applying a Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.9. The economic benefits are calculated as the difference between the “with the project” and “without the project” scenarios. The benefits include road user incremental benefits in terms of vehicle operating cost savings, time savings for passengers and cargo, and road maintenance savings from use of the upgraded project road. The current annual average daily traffic (AADT) on the different project road sections range from 6,997 to 11,880 vehicles per day. Traffic forecasting considered three categories of traffic, namely, normal, generated and diverted. For normal traffic based on medium growth rates, the annual growth rates due to increase upgraded road is estimated at 6.9% from 2020-2030, 5.2% from 2031 and 3.9% from 2037 onwards. 3.1.2 The measures of project worth used are the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and the Net Present Value (NPV). The economic analysis base results based on medium traffic growth rates indicate that the upgraded project road yield an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 29.0% with NPV of USD348.7 million at a 12% discount factor. Sensitivity analysis results of a simultaneous increase in investment costs by 20% and reduction in benefits by 20% (worst case scenario), yield an EIRR of 22.7% and NPV of USD 228.9 million. The EIRR even in the worst case scenario is higher than the cost for capital for Kenya at 12.0%. Hence it can be concluded that the development solution chosen for the project road is economically viable. Switching values also support the conclusion.’ 5.

The estimated borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 1% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Lesotho and a consortium consisting of Sinoma International Engineering Co., Ltd. and TBEA Xinjiang New Energy.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 30MW photovoltaic solar power plant — in the locality of Ha-Ramarothole within the district of Mafeteng — on a 220-hectare plot of land. It also involves the upgrading of the Ramarothole Sub-Station and installation of the high-voltage transmission line back to Masianokeng Sub-Station from where power will be distributed nationwide.   Sinoma International Engineering Co., Ltd. and TBEA Xinjiang New Energy are the contractors responsible for implementation.  A formal groundbreaking (sod-turning) ceremony took place on December 16, 2020. However, the ceremony was almost aborted at the 11th hour as angry villagers demanded a stop to the project until they had been compensated for the loss of their land which will be the site of the project. The ceremony only went ahead after a senior representative from the Government of Lesotho (Mohapi Mohapinyane, the Minister of Energy and Meteorology) met with Principal Chief Seeiso and promised to compensate the villagers in the next two weeks. This project has also been plagued by controversy and accusations of corruption and artificially inflated pricing. The Directorate on Corruption and Economic Offences (DCEO) launched an investigation to establish how the tender was awarded by the Government of Lesotho to Sinoma International Engineering Co., Ltd. and TBEA Xinjiang New Energy.   In a December 3030 interview with the Lesotho Times, Finance Minister Thabo Sophonea said that the government was forging ahead with the project because there were just allegations and no compelling evidence of any irregularities in the awarding of the tender. More specifically, he said “On our side we do not have any solid evidence of anything untoward, there are just allegations. […] There is nothing concrete. The DCEO and other departments have not written to us to indicate that there is a corruption behind this project. Yes, the allegations are there but you cannot stop acting unless you have a direct order or evidence stopping you. […] It is their (DCEO) duty to investigate but then again we have to continue with the development of the country until the DCEO has something tangible to act on. It is their duty to investigate whatever they think has not been properly done but unless something solid can be brought to us, we cannot stop. We are happy they are continuing with the investigations but now we have to go ahead because we are already late in starting this project.” The DCEO began probing the deal in the wake of an exposé by the Lesotho Times of a massive scandal in which some senior officials in the Thabane administration, including former Energy Minister Mokoto Hloaele, reportedly agreed to the bloated deal with Sinoma International Engineering Co., Ltd. and TBEA Xinjiang New Energy in exchange for bribes. Former Energy Minister Mokoto Hloaele is alleged to have received a sizeable bribe along with former First Lady Maesaiah Thabane and others to facilitate the deal. Hloaele has since denied receiving any bribes. He has instead challenged current Development Planning Minister Selibe Mochoboroane to explain how the Government of Lesotho agreed to the deal, saying it was Mochoboroane and not him who signed a cooperation agreement for the project with Sinoma International Engineering Co., Ltd. and TBEA Xinjiang New Energy. 1.

China Eximbank official Zeng Ming promised the project was in the final procedural stages before funding could be released. Then, on August 18, 2020, the Government of Malawi and China Eximbank signed an RMB 693 million governmental concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase II of the National Fibre Backbone Project.  The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: March 21, 2040), a 6.5 year grace period (first repayment date: March 21, 2027), a 1% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The proceeds of the loan were on-lent to the Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi.    In a Mid Year Public Debt Report for 2020/2021 Financial Year, Malawi’s Ministry of Finance noted that the loan had ‘registered significant disbursements’. By June 2023, the loan had disbursed RMB 299,286,770.33. The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 299,286,770.33 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 22,169,390.39 between 2028 and 2040.  The purpose of Phase II is to construct a national data recovery center, lay nearly 3,000 kilometers of fiber optic cables, and install a video-conferencing system in government offices.   Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for project implementation.  Phase II was officially launched by Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera on June 29, 2021. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. commissioned Malawi's first-ever National Data Cente on July 21, 2022 in the country's second-largest city of Blantyre. Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera said the data center would give Malawi a stake in the 4th Industrial Revolution of big data, artificial intelligence, digital financial services and the internet of things (IoT), among others.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase II of the National Fibre Backbone Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2021, Malawi's Minister of Finance announced that ‘in 2020/21 FY, Government [of Malawi] requested temporary debt service suspension from bilateral creditors. This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In July 2023 correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Government of Malawi revealed that it was in negotiations with China Eximbank about rescheduling all of their loans with amounts outstanding. The Government of Malawi proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 50 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 90 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 89 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 88 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 87 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 86 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 85 million in principal and interest payments in 2032. China Eximbank proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 148 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 299 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 294 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 228 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 121 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 101 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 82 million in principal and interest payments in 2032. As of July 2023, a debt rescheduling deal had not yet been reached by the parties. 1. The World Bank's Debtor Reporting System identifies the face value of the loan as $100,489,208.20 (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/kwxk7hpv0dyicpi/DRS%20Official%20Commitments%20from%20China%20through%202020.csv?dl=0). 2.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 6.5 years, and a 2% interest rate.    The purpose of the project is to expand and modernize the telecommunication network of Moçambique Telecom SA (Tmcel) such that it can accommodate 4G technology.  Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for the implementation of the 4G project. Project implementation commenced on or around January 2022.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the TmCel Telecommunications Network Expansion and Modernization Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283). 1. This project is also known as the Modernization and Expansion of the National Mobile Network (Tmcel).

67051,"ICBC contributes to $2.45 billion syndicated loan for Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Gas Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#67052, #60925) In June 2017, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) — a Nigerian state-owned oil company — submitted a proposal for the Ajaokuta–Kaduna–Kano (AKK) natural gas pipeline project to the Government of Nigeria's Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC). The project’s feasibility study was approved in the July 2017. A PPP compliance certificate was also issued for the project in July 2017. Then, in December 2017, Nigeria’s Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the project.  In 2020, NNPC signed a $2,456,944,166.11 syndicated loan agreement with Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Gas Pipeline Project. Bank of China’s contribution is captured via Project ID#67052 and ICBC’s contribution is captured via Project ID#67051. The estimated borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 12-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.75% margin, and a 7% Sinosure insurance premium. The Federal Government of Nigeria issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan (in January 2020), which accounts for 85% of the total project cost ($2,890,522,548.36). The Nigerian Gas Company — a subsidiary of NNPC — agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the project cost ($433,578,382.25) through an equity contribution.  According to the Government of Nigeria's Debt Management Office, '[t]he [Federal Government of Nigeria's] Contingent Liabilities increased in the 2020 due to the inclusion of the Contingent Liabilities arising from the Federal Government of Nigeria guarantee issued in respect of the NNPC-AKK Gas Pipeline Project executed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).'  The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between NNPC and a consortium consisting of Brentex Petroleum Services Ltd and China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co Ltd (CPP), which was awarded on April 27, 2017 and signed on April 10, 2018. The borrower is expected to repay the loan through a pipeline transmission tariff.   The purpose of the project is to build a 614 km pipeline that will carry natural gas between the southern and northern parts of Nigeria. The pipeline will originate at the Ajaokuta terminal gas station (TGS) in the Kogi state in southern Nigeria and pass through Niger, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and Kaduna to terminate at a gas station at Kano. The pipeline will cross seven major rivers and ten major roads along its route. The AKK pipeline project is divided into four segments. The first segment will run from Ajaokuta to Abuja in the FCT for a total distance of approximately 200 km. The second segment will extend for 193 km from the Abuja TGS to the Kaduna TGS, while the third segment will stretch for 97km from Kaduna to Zaria, and the fourth and final section of the pipeline will run for approximately 124km from Zaria to the Kano TGS. The pipeline will comprise 40 inch-diameter pipe joints and operate at a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSIG). The Ajaokuta–Kaduna–Kano (AKK) pipeline will transport up to 3,500 million cubic feet (mcf) of gas a day from various gas gathering projects in southern Nigeria. Hydrocarbon liquids will be processed at Ajaokuta to produce liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), while the remaining gas will be transported to supply feedstock for new power plants and petrochemical facilities at Abuja, Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina. The pipeline will eventually reach North Africa, forming part of the broader 4,400km Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline which will export natural gas to customers in Europe.  Brentex Petroleum Services Ltd, China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co Ltd (CPP), Oilserve, and China First Highway Engineering Company are the contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction began on June 30, 2020. Then, in July 2021, the financing for the construction of the pipeline became complicated due to the fact that Bank of China decided to withhold loan disbursements. The project will be implemented in three phases, and as of August 8, 2022, the project was in Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the construction of a 200 km-long segment between Ajaokuta and Abuja Terminal Gas Station at the cost of $855 million. Phase 2 will consist of a 193 km-long section built between Abuja and Kaduna at the cost of approximately $835 million, and Phase 3 will consist of a 221km-long section built between the Kaduna terminal gas station (TGS) and Kano TGS and cost an estimated $1.2 billion. 1.

The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB. Then, on January 18, 2019, AGTF signed an EUR 43.19 million loan agreement (ID#5050200000601) with the Government of Benin for the Kérou-Banikoara Section of the Djougou-Péhunco-Kérou-Banikoara Road Project. On the same day, the African Development Bank (AfDB) issued an EUR 119.93 million loan (ID#2000200003551) to the Government of Benin for the same project.  The borrowing terms of these loans are follows: a 25-year maturity, an 8-year grace period, an interest rate of EURIBOR plus a 1% margin, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% upfront (management) fee.   The purpose of the project is upgrade and tar the 64.26 km Kérou-Banikoara section of the Djougou-Péhunco-Kérou-Banikoara Road (or ‘Cotton Road’). The 64.26 km road section is divided into 2 lots (a 41 km lot and a 23.26 km lot). The 41 km lot is being financed by AGTF and AfDB and the 23.26 km lot is being financed by BOAD and the Government of Benin. This modern earth road is in a very poor state. Its geometric and structural features are not appropriate for traffic and the rainfall and topographic environment. The purpose of the project is, therefore, to improve the level of service of the road. The expected outcomes of upgrading and tarring the road are increase in traffic and trade, reduction in generalized transportation costs and improvement of the living conditions of the population along the road. The reduction in generalized transportation costs on the road will lead to a fall in the cost of production and export of cotton, Benin’s main export crop, and, hence, an improvement in the country’s competitiveness. The expected project beneficiaries are transport service users and the municipalities of Djougou, Péhunco, Kérou and Banikoara.

Then, on October 2, 2019, the Government of Burkina Faso authorized the ratification of the credit agreement. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 12-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.5% margin, a management fee of 4%, a commitment fee of 0.8%. The loan is also backed by a Sinosure buyer’s credit insurance policy. The total cost of the buyer's credit insurance premium $6,843,413.73. Bank of China reportedly agreed to provide 60% of the funding needed for the first phase of PBNT while the other 40% would be provided by BNP Paribas. However, on October 8, 2019, the BNP Paribas announced that it was no longer involved in this project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the Bank of China loan to partially finance a commercial contract that it signed with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  in July 2014.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 307-kilometer fiber optic network linking the capital Ouagadougou and the city of Po, near the Ghanaian border. This fiber optic ‘backbone’ will have a capacity of 1,600 gigabits per second and will ten municipalities. It is parter of a larger, EUR 175 million program to provide 5,740 km of fiber optic coverage in Burkina Faso, at a cost of 175 million euros. Construction began on December 10, 2017.  Phase 1 was completed and officially inaugurated on October 26, 2021. 1.

58761,"China Eximbank provides $301 million preferential buyer’s credit for N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project On November 26, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a $301,098,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.75% commitment fee. The loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) revenues that will be generated by an airport tax (called “GoPass”). The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $354,680,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Régie des Voies Aériennes de la République Démocratique du Congo) (RVA) and Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative Co., Ltd. (WIETEC), which was signed on September 16, 2013.     The purpose of the project is to construct a new airport terminal — with an area of ​​40,617 m2 including a ground floor for arrivals — at N'djili International Airport in Kinshasa. The project also involves the installation of check-in counters, arrival and departure baggage rooms, public areas, shopping centers, a foundation, and a parking lot (with the ability to accommodate 1200 vehicles). WIETEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.     A foundation-laying ceremony took place on May 2, 2018. As of May 2020, the DRC’s Minister of Transport Didier Mazengu Mukanzu reported to Parliament that the project’s technical and topographical studies and feasibility studies were 80% complete. By September 2020, the project design process was complete and implementation was expected to start by the end of 2020. As of December 2020, all of the necessary materials and equipment were on-site to begin construction but project implementation had stalled due to the fact that the Congolese Government had not met its counterpart funding commitment. China Eximbank was also withholding loan disbursements. In August 2021, Alphonse Shungu, the Director General of the RVA, reported that the project had only achieved a 9.21% completion rate.   Then, in 2021 and 2021, Qatar Airways Group (QAG) reportedly prepared a major contract for the renovation and management of three strategic airports in the DRC: N'djili International Airport, Ndolo Airport and Lubumbashi Airport. The feasibility studies were entrusted to the Dutch company NACO, which specializes in airport infrastructure. The two parties, who signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2021, agreed on a public-private partnership (PPP) under which QAG would shoulder the cost of renovating and updating the three airports on its own, in exchange for managing it for an unspecified length of time (perhaps as long as thirty years). Under these terms, RVA would no longer manage these airports, depriving it of the bulk of its revenues, especially of the highly controversial ‘go-pass’ tax that travelers have to pay.   Also, as of September 2022, the Congolese Government was reportedly looking to end its partnership with Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative (WIETC) for the construction of the new N'djili airport. 1. Some sources refer to this project as the N’djili and Luano Airport Terminals Project, noting that the cost of constructing the new N’djili Airport Terminal is $354,680,000 and the cost of constructing the new Luano Airport Terminal is $201,131,205. It is unclear if China Eximbank or another financier is supporting the construction of the Luano Airport Terminal. This issue warrants further investigation. 2. The World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS) records $602,196,254 of borrowing by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo from official sector lenders from China in 2019. However, for the time being, AidData only records a single borrowing (for the $301,098,000 PBC for the N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project) in 2019.

Then, on November 10, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMP) issued a $150 million supplier’s credit (‘CMP Loan Facility’) agreement with Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CMP loan, captured via Project ID#59393, carried the following borrowing terms: a 5% annual interest rate, a 1.25-year maturity (with the option to extend the maturity by 8.75 additional years), and no grace period.   The Government of Djibouti — through the state-owned Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) — issued a sovereign guarantee for repaying the supplier's credit. The loan was collateralized by a share pledge over 15.3% of the shares held by Great Horn Investment Holdings SAS (a subsidiary of DPFZA) in a China-Djibouti joint venture called Port De Djibouti S.A., which is co-owned the Government of Djibouti (76.5% equity stake) and China Merchants Port Holdings Company Ltd.

(PDSA)  Then, in 2019, China Development Bank and Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. signed a $240 million loan agreement (ID#4430201901100002407) for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CDB loan, which is captured via Project ID#85139, carried the following borrowing terms: a 13 year maturity and a 3 year grace period. China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co., Ltd. provided a loan guarantee worth $14.4 million (6% of $240 million CDB loan). The Government of Djibouti provided a sovereign guarantee for 60% of the face value of the loan ($144 million). The DIFTZ is a 40-hectare zone that consists of three functional blocks located close to all of Djibouti’s major ports.   The purpose of the DIFTZ is to support industries such as the logistics, marine, construction, automotive, and home electrical industries. It is equipped with advanced facilities including high-speed telecommunications, power and water supplies, roads and parking lots. The pilot zone has four industrial clusters which focus on trade and logistics, export processing and business support: (1) Logistics Industry Cluster: transportation, bonded warehousing, logistics and distribution; (2) Business Industry Cluster: bulk bonded goods transactions, merchandise display, duty-free merchandise retail; (3) Business Support Cluster: financial services, information services, hotel dormitories, office buildings, training, intermediary services; and (4) Processing Manufacturing Cluster: packaging production, light processing of incoming materials, food processing, marine products, auto parts assembly.   China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE (“CM Djibouti”) was the company responsible for project implementation. On January 16, 2017, Djiboutian President Guelleh and General Manager of China Merchants Group Hu Jianhua unveiled the launch area and laid a foundation stone for the DIFTZ expansion project. The first phase of the project, which involved upgrading and expanding the port facilities of DIFTZ, was officially opened on July 5, 2018. 1. This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Project and Phase 1 of the DIFTZ at PK 23 Project. The Chinese project title is 吉布提国际自贸区于 or 布提自贸区建设项目2. The Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) is the sole government authority in charge of the administration and the control of all the free zones and ports in Djibouti.3.

Under the BRI banner, Chinese SOEs, especially China Merchants Group (CMG), have been attempting to replicate elements of its “port in front-(industrial) park in the middle-city behind” or Port-Park-City (PPC) model in Africa. The model is based on the Shekou Industrial Park in Shenzhen city in China’s Guangdong Province, established in 1979. It was the country’s first special economic zone, and it sparked Shenzhen’s growth as a commercial and industrial hub. CMG’s efforts to build the village of Shekou into a world-class industrial zone resulted in an area without basic infrastructure being transformed into a modern metropolitan center. The Shekou Model “entails developing adjacent industrial parks, commercial buildings, highways, free trade zones, residential areas, and power plants.” With the focus on the port, the model does not aim only to facilitate the transportation of goods but to “develop a larger, integrated system that helps sustain the port and is sustained by it in turn”. In 2017, Li Xiaopeng, president of CMG, mentioned that his company is using the Shekou Model as a template or a concept that can be applied and tweaked to adjust to its port projects worldwide.” 5.

58094,"China Eximbank provides $461 million loan for Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project (Linked to Project ID#52700 and ID#64740) On April 2, 2014, AVIC International signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Egyptian Ministry of Communications on the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. Then, on August 15, 2017, Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT) signed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract worth $1.239 billion with a consortium consisting of AVIC International and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group, a subsidiary of China Railway Group. Then, on November 5, 2017, at the “BRICS Summit” in Xiamen, China, the Egyptian Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation and China’s Ministry of Commerce signed a MoU on the implementation of the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. On September 1, 2018, two agreements were signed by the Chinese Government and the Egyptian Government in support of the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project: an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), authorizing the provision of an RMB 350 million (approximately $51 million) interest-free loan from China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM); and a government concessional loan (GCL) from China Eximbank worth RMB 4.604 billion (approximately $674 million). Then, on January 15, 2019, the Egyptian House of Representatives passed two government resolutions [Resolution No. 497 (2018) and Resolution No. 496 (2018)], approving the RMB 350 million interest-free loan from MOFCOM and the RMB 4.604 billion loan from China Eximbank.   Multiple sources refer to these two loans (collectively worth an estimated $739 million) as providing the ‘first tranche’ of funding for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. The MOFCOM loan was issued to Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (埃及国家隧道局) and it appears to carry the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a 10 year grace period, and a 0% interest rate. The Government of Egypt issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this loan. The China Eximbank loan was also issued to Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels and it appears to carry the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 1.8% interest rate. It too benefited from a sovereign guarantee.   Then, on January 16, 2019, China Eximbank and Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels signed another loan agreement for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project, which reportedly carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 2 year grace period, 2% interest rate. This loan also benefited from a sovereign guarantee. Some sources identify the face value of this loan as $1.239 billion (covering both the first and second tranches of funding), while others refer to the face value of the loan as $461 million (covering only the second tranche of funding).   For the time being, AidData assumes that the first tranche of funding was officially committed on September 1, 2018 and the second tranche of funding was officially committed on January 16, 2019. The RMB 350 million loan is captured via Project ID#64740. The RMB 4.604 billion loan is captured via Project ID#52700. The $461 million loan is captured via Project ID#58094. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of these loans to finance the $1.239 billion commercial (EPC) contract between Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT), AVIC International, and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group, which was signed on August 15, 2017.   The purpose of the project is to build a Light Rail Transit (LRT) network that extends from El Salam to New Administrative Capital to 10 Ramadan City. The electric light railway will extend 67.8 km (42 miles) from 10th of Ramadan City to Egypt’s New Administrative Capital with 11 stops/stations (in the cities of Salam, Obour, Shorouk, Mostaqbal, Robeiky, and the New Administrative Capital). 61 km of the lines will be above ground, 0.7 km below ground, and 6.1 km will be elevated. Some 7.5 kilometers will be in the form of a bridge, while 0.3 kilometers will be in the form of a tunnel. The speed of the trains will be 120 km/h. The trains will be equipped with non-internal-combustion diesel engines.   The line will start from Adly Mansour Station that is reached by the third metro line, and at Robeiky will be divided into two branches. One will head north in parallel to the Regional Ring Road to the 10th of Ramadan City and the other will head South to the New Administrative Capital. The line will be operated within two years, and will be executed by five Egyptian companies along with the railroads and the fence.  The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) will accomplish the signaling, communication, control, and electricity systems afterwards. It will also manufacture and supply 22 trains. In the second phase, the line will extend to the Sports City near Al-Ain Al-Sokhna so that its length will be 93 kilometers.   The project is intended to reduce the travel time between the 10th of Ramadan City to the New Administrative Capital by about 30%. The realization of the Electric Light Railway Project is expected to reduce traffic, principally on Ismailia highway. Additionally, the project is expected to stimulate Egypt’s construction industry, providing jobs to many.   AVIC International and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group are the general contractors responsible for implementation. Their subcontractors include: (1) a joint venture between TSO and Orascom Construction (for track laying and the construction of 11 stations); (2) Arab Contractors (for construction of Adly Mansour, New Heliopolis and Robaikey stations); (3) Hassan Allam Holding (for construction of the New Government Capital and New Administrative Capital stations); (4) Concord (for construction of Badr and Shorouk stations); (5) Petrojet (for construction of Abour and Future stations); (6) The Holding Co. for Roads, Bridges and Land Transportation Projects (for construction of Industrial Park and Ramadan 1 stations); (7) CRRC Qingdao Sifang (for supply of rolling stock); (8) Consortium of CASCO and China Huaxin (for signaling and communication system); and (9) Siveco China [for supply of Maintenance Management System (MMS)]. In January 2019, China Eximbank reportedly agreed to disburse a $105 million tranche within a month to facilitate the commencement of civil works.   The project was originally expected to begin implementation on January 20, 2019. However, civil works did not commence until May 2019. On October 30, 2020, Egypt’s Transport Minister Kamal El-Wazir conducted an inspection tour of the project. At that time, the project had achieved a 63% completion rate. Bridges were 47% complete, tunnels were 86% complete, and the maintenance workshop was 63% complete. Then, on March 18, 2021, Shenzhen Metro and AVIC International signed a comprehensive joint commissioning service contract for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. The first of 22 trains (manufactured by CRRC Qingdao Sifang) left a port in Shandong in July 2021 and arrived in Egypt on September 7, 2021. As of November 2021, 6 trains had arrived and 95% of construction activities were complete. According to the Egyptian State Information Service, as of May 9, 2022, all 22 trains acquired as part of the project had been received by the Egyptian Ministry of Transportation and they were undergoing testing, with the National Authority for Tunnels confirming that the train line was being 'operated experimentally' as of June 5, 2022. 1. This project is also known as the 10th of Ramadan Railway Project, the Suburban Railway Project of Tenth of Ramadan City, Egypt Ramadan City Railway Project, the Egyptian Electric Railway Project, the Light Railway Project, and the 10 Ramadan-Salam Train Project. The Chinese project title is 埃及“斋月十日城”市郊铁路项目 or 埃及斋月十日城铁路项目 or 中埃铁路项目. The Arabic project title is لمشروع القطار الكهربائى السلام ـ العاصمة الإدارية. 2. 2. The borrower may have been authorized to use the proceeds of the loans to finance a rolling stock (vehicle supply) contract that was issued to CRRC Qingdao Sifang on December 3, 2018, an automation and controls contract (or Communication and Signaling System Procurement and Maintenance Framework Contract) that was issued to China Huaxin Post and Telecom Technologies (Huaxin) on August 23, 2019, and an operation and supervision service contract that AVIC International, China Railway Group and Shenzhen Metro signed on December 6, 2019. This issue merits further investigation. 3. MOFCOM is the lending institution responsible for the provision of the RMB 350 million interest-free loan but the proceeds of the loan were disbursed through a China Development Bank (CDB) account that was established with a host country bank. 4. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, two China Eximbank loans for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project are recorded, but not the RMB 350 million interest-free loan from MOFCOM",False,0.48774
58134,"China Eximbank, ICBC, and BoC provide $2.76 billion syndicated buyer’s credit for construction of Central Business Zone in New Administrative Capital In 2014, Egyptian President el-Sisi proposed the construction of a New Administrative Capital (NAC) and identified this project as the ‘the locomotive of Egypt's future development.’ The project is part of a broader effort to switch Egypt’s capital city from Cairo to a brand-new constructed smart city called the NAC. The establishment of the NAC seeks to alleviate Greater Cairo’s increasing densification and establish a new growth hub for future generations. It will house Egypt’s 29 government ministries and contain 20 residential neighborhoods, an airport, hotels, malls, parks. Upon completion, it is projected to have enough space to accommodate 6.5 million inhabitants. In January 2016, the Egyptian Government and China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) signed a general contracting framework agreement regarding a project to construct the Central Business District (CBD) of the NAC. Then, on October 11, 2017, at a launch ceremony for the NAC Project, Egyptian Minister of Housing, Public Facilities, and Urban Development, Mustafa Mabdili, signed a general (commercial) contract worth $3,000,000,000 for the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) of the NAC with the Vice President of CSCEC, Zheng Xuexuan. The contract specifies that CSCEC is responsible for the construction of 18 high-rise towers (including administrative offices, hotels, entertainment facilities, and the tallest tower in Africa), which were organized into three batches and scheduled for financing via three separate loan tranches (all of which have reached financial close).    Then, on April 28, 2019, a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks signed a $2.76 billion syndicated (buyer’s credit) loan agreement with the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) — an Egyptian Government authority affiliated with the Ministry of Housing — for the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) in the NAC. Participants in the loan syndicate include the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and Bank of China (BOC). ICBC is the lead arranger of the syndicated loan and it contributed $610 million to the syndicate. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of the $3,000,000,000 commercial contract that was signed with CSCEC on October 11, 2017. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 13.5-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and 2-3% interest rate.  The Government of Egypt reportedly provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. Sinosure provided $3.88 billion of buyer’s credit insurance (to cover the loan’s principal and interest). The Sinosure-covered project cashflow analysis reportedly accounted for projected apartment rental and sales, hotel & retail rentals, and centralized advertising revenues. The first tranche of the syndicated loan’s three tranches was worth $843,000,000 and it was earmarked for the construction of seven high-rise towers (5 residential and 2 commercial towers) in the CBD. Then, in July 2019, NUCA signed an agreement with eight Chinese banks (including ICBC) and HSBC Bank Middle East Limited to receive the second tranche of the loan (also known as the “Batch 2 Towers” Project). On December 24, 2020, the Egyptian Government announced that the third and final loan tranche would soon be disbursed and NUCA signed an agreement with seven Chinese banks (including ICBC, Bank of China, China Eximbank, China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings Bank of China, and China CITIC Bank) to receive the third tranche of the loan (also known as the “Batch 3 Towers” Project). The first tranche was due to be disbursed in January 2020. However, on January 31, 2020, Al Monitor — an Egyptian newspaper — reported that the first tranche of the loan had not disbursed as expected in January 2020. According to the newspaper, the Egyptian government did not initially meet conditions attached to the loan facility and the Chinese bank syndicate was concerned about whether the Egyptian government could repay the loan.    The CBD is located in the center of Egypt’s New Administrative Capital, 45 km east of Cairo. The CBD is expected to cover 505,000 m^2, and it include Africa’s tallest building at 385.8 meter named “Iconic Tower” (Arabic: البرج الأيقوني‎), 12 high rise commercial office buildings, 5 high-rise apartments, 2 hotels, and a total of 18 high rise buildings and municipal projects. CSCEC’s Eighth Bureau is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has reportedly provided direct employment opportunities for 5,000 workers, while indirectly employing 30,000 people.    Dar al-Handasah Shair & Partners is responsible for architectural design and supervision. Project implementation commenced on May 2, 2018. On February 26, 2019, the foundation bottom slab concreting of the main building of the Iconic Tower was completed. In March 2020, the structural frame of the CO3 Office Building was completed and the first curtain wall body was installed for the C04 Tower (Commercial Building), which marked the beginning of the external curtain wall installation stage. Construction activities continued during the Covid-19 pandemic. On October 25, 2020, a topping-off ceremony was held for the 27-floor, C12 Tower (Commercial Building) Then, on June 17, 2021, a topping-off ceremony was held for the 385.8 meter, 80-storey Iconic Tower (which was planned and inspired by the shape of a pharaonic obelisk with glass exterior). CSCEC reported in 2021 that it had completed the construction of 13 buildings in the NAC, including the Iconic Tower (also known as the C03 Tower). As of September 2022, the project had completed the main construction of all 20 buildings and had entered the decoration and electromechanical installation stage. At that time, the project as a whole was expected to reach completion by the end of 2023. However, according to the terms of the commercial contract that was signed on October 11, 2017, the project was originally expected to reach completion within 43 months (by May 11, 2021). 1. This project is also known as the construction of the Central Business District project of the NAC. The Chinese project title is 新首都中央商务区标志塔项目 or 埃及新首都中央商务区案例 or 在新首都项目 or 埃及新首都CBD项目 or 埃及新首都中央商务区标志塔项目 or 埃及新首都中央商务区项目 or 埃及新首都中央商务区项目 or 新首都中央商务区项目. The Arabic project title is لمشروع القطار الكهربائى السلام ـ العاصمة الإدارية.   2. Sinosure notes in its 2019 Annual Report that it provided $1.17 billion of credit insurance for the first batch for the construction projects (See Sinosure Annual Report 2019, pg. 33). This seems to be a reference to the first tranche of the loan (i.e. insurance cover for the first tranche of the loan’s principal and interest).  3. Some sources suggest that the face value of the loan agreement signed on April 28, 2019 was $2.76 billion and covered all three tranches. However, other sources (such as https://www.tagmydeals.com/Deals/DealData/11780?title=New-Urban-Communities-Authority-Sinosure-Covered) suggest that the agreement only committed funds for the first tranche. This issue merits further investigation. 4.  One source suggests that the loan's second tranche (https://www.tagmydeals.com/Deals/DealData/11780?title=New-Urban-Communities-Authority-Sinosure-Covered) was worth $1.36 billion. This issue warrants further investigation.5. On December 24, 2020, NUCA reportedly signed a “third loan agreement” with a syndicate of banks — including CBC, Bank of China, National Bank of Kuwait, Export-Import Bank of China, HSBC, Bank of Communications, Citic, China Construction Bank, and the Postal Savings Bank of China — for the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) of the New Administrative Capital Some sources (like https://www.tagmydeals.com/Deals/DealData/12986?title=Egypts-New-Administrative-Capital-Project-Sinosure-Covered-Loan) suggest that the face value of the loan agreement signed on December 25, 2020 may have been worth approximately $800 million, which suggests that the agreement was in fact an agreement for the third tranche of the $2.76 billion syndicated loan. This issue merits further investigation. 6. The loan’s interest rate is not documented by any official sources. However, Bloomberg reports that it is between 2% and 3%. Therefore, for the time being AidData has coded the interest rate as 2.5%. This issue merits further investigation. 7. The $2.76 billion syndicated loan that was issued in 2019 is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020.

The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB.   Then, on February 7, 2019, AGTF signed an EUR 32,170,000 loan agreement (ID#5050200000651) with the Government of Gabon for the First Libreville Integrated Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Sub-Programme (PIAEPAL). On the same day, the African Development Bank’s African Development Fund issued a EUR 56,070,000 loan (ID#2000200003602) to the Government of Gabon for the same project. The borrowing terms of the AGTF loan are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 0.8% margin, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first AGTF loan disbursement took place on September 17, 2019. However, as of May 2022, the AGTF loan had only achieved a 0.12% disbursement rate (EUR 9,732.58 out of EUR 32,170,000).   The project is structured around the following main components: (A) development of DWS infrastructure including: (i) renovation of 149 km of the Libreville water supply network, (ii) reinforcement and extension of 131 km of the Libreville water supply network; and (iii) repair of leakages in administrative buildings; (B) improvement of sector governance and capacity building, including: (i) equipping beneficiary ministries; (ii) training the main stakeholders; (iii) technical studies for infrastructure development and knowledge of water resources; (iv) sector studies and assistance for institutional reform of the sector; and (C) project coordination and management, including: (i) equipment for the Coordination Unit; (ii) technical assistance for project implementation; and (iii) operating costs.   The project will cover four Greater Libreville municipalities: Libreville, Akanda, Owendo and Ntoum. Libreville's total population in 2016 was estimated at 967,095. It is expected that 300,000 additional people, or 31% of the city's population, will have access to drinking water as a result of the network extension works. Due to the project, the drinking water access rate for the Libreville urban population is expected to increase from 55% to 90%. In addition to Libreville residents, the project is expected benefit local industries and other production and service structures such as government departments, including the Ministry of Water and Energy, the Ministry of Works, barracks, the Service Company, schools and hospitals. Other expected beneficiaries include economic operators that will execute works and provide services during project implementation.  The project has encountered various contracting obstacles during the the COVID-19 pandemic. As of January 2022, the project had achieved a 25% completion rate. The project was originally expected to reach completion in December 2022. 1. The AfDB project identification number is P-GA-E00-001. 2. The project’s economic rate of return is estimated at 13.99. 3.

30578,"China Development Bank provides $185.57 million loan for Ghana Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project (Linked to Project ID#2034) On December 16, 2011, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a $3 billion master facility agreement (captured via Project ID#2034). This agreement established two lending facilities: Tranche A and Tranche B. Tranche A is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 15 year maturity, 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, a 0.25% upfront fee, and a 1% commitment fee. Tranche B is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 10 year maturity, 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee. Both tranches are collateralized against cash proceeds from the sale of crude oil from the Jubilee field, which the borrower was required to deposit in a debt service reserve account (DSRA). The cash balance of the DSRA was GHS 370,586,909 ($71,266,713) in 2019.  [Note: A requirement of the master facility agreement was that the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co. (UNIPEC Asia) sign an offtaker for the sale and purchase of crude oil. Under the terms of this agreement, GNPC agreed to supply and sell 13,000 barrels of crude oil from Jubilee Field each day to UNIPEC Asia over a 15.5 year period. The proceeds from these oil sales were then deposited into a special account to facilitate loan repayment and provide a source of collateral.]   Under the terms of the master facility agreement, subsidiary loan agreements must be negotiated to secure financial support for any given project. On April 17, 2019, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a subsidiary loan agreement worth $185,570,000 — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project. This project was originally identified as eligible for lending through the Tranche A facility; however, the Government of Ghana and CDB agreed to fund it through the Tranche B facility and shorten the maturity of the loan to ensure that the off-taker agreement did not extend beyond its current term. As such, the terms of lending for this project (9 year maturity, 3 year grace period, 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee) were slightly different than the terms specified for lending through the Tranche B facility in the master facility agreement signed on December 16, 2011. The borrower was also responsible for paying a 5.56% (approximately $8.77 million) lump sum Sinosure premium and maintaining a minimum cash balance of 1.3 times the repayment amount for each six month cycle in a designated DSRA at all times. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $195,507,564.00 commercial contract [ID#GPHA-CHEC-11-FLS] between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC) and Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA), which was signed in August 2012 (and then amended on July, 6 2018). The Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project involves the development of 12 coastal fishing ports and fish landing sites with related on-land facilities.   The (principal) amount outstanding under the Tranche B lending facility was GHS 1,505,360,000 ($268,814,285) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 1,107,600,000 ($213,000,000) as of December 31, 2021.  These fishing ports, landing sites and related facilities are located in Axim and Dixcove in the Western Region, Otuam, Moree, Mumford, Winneba, Senya Beraku, Gomoa Fete and Elmina in the Central Region, Teshie and James Town in the Greater Accra Region, and Keta in the Volta Region. The facilities will include breakwater for a sheltered berthing and anchorage bay; quay walls for the berthing, loading/unloading of canoes and trawlers; navigational aids for the safe arrival and departure of canoes and trawlers; fish handling sheds for the transfer and sale of fresh fish under all weather conditions, ice blocks/crush making plant for the manufacture and sale of ice blocks of crushed blocks to fisherman; net mending and drying yards for fishermen to spread and mend or dry their nets; pre-mixed fuel supply yard for the installation of pre-mixed fuel tanks for sale of pre-mixed fuel to fishermen; canoe/trawler repair yard for the maintenance and repair of damaged vessels; maintenance and repair of outboard motors and marine engines yards; services to the fishing ports (e.g. roads, driveways, water and power supply, telephone lines); and port administration building to accommodate the port management and the staff of the Department of Fisheries.   CHEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Its EPC contract specifies that construction was to commence within 56 days of the signing of the subsidiary loan agreement (April 17, 2019). A formal groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place at the Axim fishing port in the Western Region on July 24, 2019. However, project implementation did not begin until August 22, 2019. As of August 2020, construction of the revetment and breakwater at the Axim fishing port was ongoing and entering its final stage, with a target completion date of September 2020. As of August 2020, construction of an underwater quay wall at the Axim fishing port was also set to be completed in January 2021.   Other planned activities at the Axim fishing port include the construction of 9 buildings, including an administration building, fish market, net mending hall, ice making plant, workshop large, fuel depot, day care, toilet, and a power station. All of these activities were expected to reach completion by September 2021. As of August 2020, the various fishing port and landing sites had achieved the following completion rates: Axim 42.01%, Dixcove is 38.23%, Moree 37.52%, Mumford 38.57%, Winneba 8.88%, Senya 90.69%, Gomoa Fete 69.82%, Teshie 38.32% and Keta 5.25%.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Ghana Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears).

The proceeds of the loan were to originally intended to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of three commercial contracts worth $236,100,000:  (1) a $85,342,469.38 commercial contract between the Government of Ghana's Ministry of Roads and Highways and China Gansu International Corporation for Economic and Technical Cooperation for the Accra Metropolitan Area Intelligent Traffic Management and Roads Completion Project - La Beach Road Completion Project Phase I (Tema Road: Independence Arch to Nungua Barrier - 16.00km);  (2) a $50,757,530.632 commercial contract between the Government of Ghana's Ministry of Roads and Highways and China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group Co. Ltd. for the Accra Metropolitan Area Intelligent Traffic Management and Roads Completion Project - La Beach Road Completion Project Phase 2 (Coastal and Meridian Roads - Nungua Barrier to Tema - 10.60 km); and  (3) a $100,000,000 commercial contract between the Government of Ghana's Ministry of Roads and Highways and Beijing Everyway Traffic & Lighting Tech. Co. Ltd. for Engineering, Procurement, Installation and Commissioning of the Accra Metropolitan Area Intelligent Traffic Management System. However, the Government of Ghana eventually canceled its commercial contract with Beijing Everyway Traffic & Lighting Tech. Co. Ltd., which resulted in the Chinese company seeking $55 million in damages via international arbitration.   The (principal) amount outstanding under the Tranche B lending facility was GHS 1,505,360,000 ($268,814,285) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 1,107,600,000 ($213,000,000) as of December 31, 2021.  The rescoped project involves the widening of the 16 km La Beach Road (Independent Arch to Nungua Barrier); the widening of 10.6 km of Coastal and Meridian Roads (including the vehicular interchange at Nungua Barrier and 2 no. road over rail bridges near Sakumono Junction and Sakumono Lagoon); and the widening of the 7.5 km Teshie Link from Teshie to the Accra-Tema Motorway.

The PBC carries the following terms: 21.25 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.75% commitment fee, and 1% management fee. The total project cost is $273 million. China Eximbank covered 95% of the total project cost and the Government of Ghana covered the remaining 5% ($13 million).    The Government of Ghana used proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), a Ghanaian state-owned company, a Ghanaian state-owned enterprise. To this end, the Government of Ghana signed a $276,250,000 subsidiary loan agreement with the GWCL on August 25, 2015. This loan carries a 15 year maturity and a 2% interest rate.    The purpose of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project was to increase the supply of water from Kpong Head Works to Accra and Tema and thereby improve the reliability of potable water delivery to domestic, commercial and industrial customers. It involved construction of a new 353,000 m3 per day intake, expansion of treatment plant to 250,000 m3 per day and construction of new transmission mains through Dodowa, Adenta to Accra Booster Station. Other works involved the provision of dedicated electricity supply, distribution improvement and construction of terminal reservoirs at Madina, Boi and Okpong.  The project was implemented in 3 phases. Phase 1 involved the construction of a new intake and water pumping station for bulk water supply from Kpong with capacity of 196,000 cubic meters per day. Phase 2 involved  the construction of a new treatment plant of 186,000 cubic meters or 41 million gallons a day. Phase 3 involved the construction of new treated water pumping station as well as a pressure transmission (mains) system from Kpong to Accra through Oyibi to terminate at Okponglo (a suburb of Accra.

64383,"ICBC and four other Chinese banks pledge $297.5 million syndicated loan for Regional University Extension and Rehabilitation Project (Linked to Project ID#65113, #64352, #86358) In 2019, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Eximbank and three other Chinese banks signed a $297.5 million syndicated loan framework agreement with the Government of Guinea for the Regional University Extension and Rehabilitation Project. If approved, this loan would be issued as a $297.5 million subsidiary loan under the $20 billion Resource and Loan Cooperation Framework Agreement that the Chinese Government and the Republic of Guinea signed on September 5, 2017 (see Project ID #65113 and #64352). As such, it carries the following borrowing terms: 15-year maturity. 4-year grace period and a 2.234% interest rate (6-month Euribor plus a 2.5% margin). The borrower would be expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of a $350 million commercial contract with China Bengbu International Technology and Economic Cooperation (CBITEC), which was signed on October 18, 2016.   The project involves the rehabilitation and extension of regional universities in Conakry-Sonfonia, Labé, Kankan, and N'zérékoré.   CBITEC is the contractor responsible for project implementation.  A foundation-laying ceremony for the construction of the regional university in Kankan, which is located between the villages of Bingo and Saramaya Villages on the Kankan-Gbérédou-Baranama road), took place on November 23, 2019. According to the commercial contract, the project was originally expected to reach completion within two years (November 23, 2021). However, as of December 2022, there was little evidence of project implementation.  Then, in January 2023, the Government of Guinea dispatched an official delegation to China to discuss potential financing for four different projects under 'Phase 2' of the $20 billion Resource and Loan Cooperation Framework Agreement that the Chinese Government and the Republic of Guinea signed on September 5, 2017. One of the projects under discussion was the Regional University Extension and Rehabilitation Project (known in French as the 'Projet de construction de quatre universités').  1.

To estimate the face value of the loan (i.e. the transaction/commitment amount), AidData calculated 85% of the total value of the commercial contract with CBITEC ($350,000,000 x 0.85 = $297,500,000). 3. The World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS) does not record any official sector Chinese loan commitments to the Government of Guinea (and/or entities backed by Government of Guinea repayment guarantees) in 2019 or 2020. The DRS indicates that official sector loan commitments from China to the Government of Guinea (and/or entities backed by Government of Guinea repayment guarantees) in 2018 amounted to $1,783,868.027. This amount is roughly equivalent to the sum of the $1,175,468,700 loan that China Eximbank issued for the 450MW Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (captured via Project ID#187) in 2018 and the EUR 559,471,286 ($598 million) loan that ICBC and China Eximbank issued for the Conakry Urban Road Project and the Reconstruction of the RN1 Coyah-Mamou-Dabola Project (captured via Project ID#65115 and ID#65116) in 2018. Consequently, AidData assumes for the time being that a loan agreement for the Regional University Extension and Rehabilitation Project was never finalized after the syndicated loan framework agreement was signed.2.

Two months later, in November 2018, CRBC undertook a project feasibility study. It then completed a technical proposal in January 2019 and a financial proposal in March 2019. Then, in April 2019, the Kenyan Government awarded a contract to CRBC for the Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway Project. A project agreement was signed on June 30, 2019. Then, on October 15, 2019, CRBC and Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) signed a a 30-year concession agreement. The total cost of the Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway Project is RMB 4.602 billion ($668 million).   It is being implemented on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. On September 8, 2019, Moja Expressway Company Limited — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of CRBC — signed a loan agreement worth approximately $501 million with an unspecified Chinese bank. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and a 7% interest rate.   China Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd. (中国路桥工程有限) and CCCC International (Hong Kong) Holdings Limited (中交国际(香港)控股有限) also agreed to make equity contributions of $133.6 million and $33.4 million, respectively, to Moja Expressway Company Limited in order to support the implementation of project. The Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway Project involves the development, operation and maintenance of an expressway between Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and James Gichuru Road. The 27.1 km expressway, with 18.2 km on the ground and 8.9 km elevated, will run from JKIA to James Gichuru road (Westlands Redhill Road Link). It will connect Mlolongo town in Machakos County with James Gichuru Road along the median strip of the A8 National Road. The 4-lane dual carriageway will have 11 interchanges at Mlolongo, Standard Gauge Railway, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass, Capital Centre, Haile Selassie Avenue, Museum Hill, Westlands, and James Gichuru Road. It will be built to a Class A standard with a design speed of 80 km/h.   CRBC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction commenced on May 4, 2019. However, a formal groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until October 16, 2019. As of July 2021 the project had achieved a 60% completion rate. By November 8, 2021, it had achieved a 75% completion rate. A main line beam erection ceremony was held on December 23, 2021 and attended by the Kenyan President, the Kenyan Minister of Transport, and the Chinese Ambassador to Kenya. By December 2021, the project had achieved a 94% completion rate. As of April 2022, it had achieved a 95% completion rate. During the construction phase, this project reportedly employed 4,000 workers. The expressway was originally scheduled to be opened to traffic on June 30, 2022. It was ultimately opened to traffic on May 14, 2022.   Under the terms of its 30-year concession (BOOT) agreement (with a 3 year construction period and 27 year operation period), CRBC is responsible for transferring the Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway back to KENHA in 2049 and it is expected to repay its loan (and recoup its equity investment) by collecting toll revenues. Once operational, each driver on the expressway will be required to pay a toll of between 109.4 and 1,641 Kenyan shillings (between $1 and $15), depending on the size of the car and the distance traveled. Over the course of the 30-year concession period, the project is expected to generate $2.765 billion. The project has been disclosed as a contingent public sector liability by the Kenyan Treasury (due to the fact that early termination of the PPP contract with Moja Expressway Company Limited would require that the Government of Kenya make termination payments to Moja Expressway Company Limited). 1. This project is also known as the JKIA-Westlands Expressway (30KM) PPP Project, the Nairobi Expressway Project, the Nairobi Expressway Road Project, the Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway Road Project, and the BOT Nairobi JKIA-James Gichuru Expressway Project. 2.

The MOU was signed by MOU was signed by the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Madagascar, Chen Xiaolei, and the Malagasy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Naina Andriatsitohaina. Then, on June 14, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Madagascar signed an RMB 1,090,000,000 (approximately $156 million or MGA 506 billion) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the RN5A (Ambilobe-Vohémar Road) Rehabilitation Project.   The project involves the rehabilitation of a 151 km road — known as RN5A — that connects Ambilobe and Vohémar in the north of Madagascar. It also involves the construction of five new bridges and the renovation of ten pre-existing bridges. The regions of Diana and Sava are among the most productive in Madagascar with cloves, cocoa and vanilla, but they suffer from the very poor quality roads. Upon completion, it is envisaged that the rehabilitated RN5A will become the main and only direct line connecting the east and west coasts and will provide a seamless route between the two cities.    China Road and Bridge Corporation  (CRBC) is the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 13, 2019 and the project was originally expected to reach completion by June 26, 2021. However,  the COVID-19 pandemic led to project implementation delays. CRBC eventually resumed construction, and as of January 2022, the project had achieved a 75% completion rate.

58435,"CPFHK provides loan for Niger Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#2137, #31046, #58433, #73319) On September 20, 2018, the Government of Niger and the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Company Ltd. (CNODC) — a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — entered into a framework agreement for the construction and operation of the cross-border crude oil export pipeline from Niger to Benin. Through this agreement, CNODC/CNPC pledged to provide $4 billion (about CFA 2 billion) of pre-export financing (PxF) to the Government of Niger for the Niger Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project.   Then, on January 23, 2019, the Government of Niger and the Government of Benin signed a bilateral agreement on the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project. Approximately four months later, on April 26, 2019, the West African Oil Pipeline (Niger) Company S.A. [WAPCo-Niger; 中油国际尼贝管道公司 or 西非石油公司) in Chinese] — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of CNPC (85% ownership stake) and the Government of Niger (15% ownership stake) — was legally incorporated and made responsible for the financing, construction, operation, maintenance and management of the Niger section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline.   Then, in September 2019, the Government of Niger and CNPC signed a transport convention on the pipeline, following a similar agreement between the Government of Benin and CNPC. The convention set third-party access rules, minimum local content shares, and transportation (transit) fees.   The total cost of the Niger Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project is $1.3 billion and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. CNPC Finance (HK) Limited (CPFHK) — a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — issued a loan worth an estimated $1.04 billion to WAPCO Niger for the Niger Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project. The loan’s estimated interest rate is 8.05%. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The borrower reportedly plans to repay CPFHK with the proceeds from crude oil sales.   The purpose of the project is to construct the 1,293 km Niger section of the 1,980 km Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline, which connects Niger's Agadem Rift Basin to the Port of Sèmè export terminal in the town of Sèmè-Kpodji. The first station of the crude oil export pipeline in Niger is located at the Koulele origin station beside the Koulele Centralized Processing Station (Agadem Koulele CPF) of Agadem Oil Zone in Diffa in southeast of Niger.  The pipeline then passes through the southwest part of Niamey, Niger’s capital. Upon completion, the pipeline is expected to have a capacity of 90,000 barrels per day (bpd).   China Petroleum Planning and Engineering Institute (CPPEI) and the China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CPPE) are the contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction began in Niger on September 17, 2019 and the pipeline was originally scheduled for completion in January 2022. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to implementation delays.  As of November 9, 2021, the Dibeilla-Koulele section of the pipeline in the Dibeilla block of Niger had completed a 40 km pipeline alignment. The Dibeilla-Koulele pipeline section alignment work started on October 27, 2021. The Dibeilla-Koulele pipeline section has a total length of 80 kilometers, a diameter of 35.56 millimeters, and wall thickness of 9.53 millimeters. Starting from the Koulele CPF station, it passes through the FANAS-1 and FANAW-1 valve chamber, and ends in the Dibeilla degassing station.  As of October 10, 2022, the project had achieved a 30% completion rate and 600 km of pipeline had been laid. Then, on October 14, 2022, Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN referred to the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project as ‘an integral part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative’. 1. This project is also known as Phase 2 of the Agadem Oil Project.

Phase 1 (captured in Project ID#73319) was supported by a $880 million China Eximbank loan that was issued in 2008 to the joint venture established between China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the Government of Niger, Société de Raffinage de Zinder (SORAZ), to process oil from CNPC’s Agadem block in Niger (captured via Project ID#2137). It involved the construction of the Soraz oil refinery in the village and rural commune of Ollelewa within Tanout Department and Zinder Region. The refinery, which was inaugurated on November 28, 2011, was designed to have a 20,000 barrel-per-day production capacity and to be fed entirely by oil from the newly-launched Agadem oilfield a further 700 km east. China Eximbank restructured the loan for Phase 1 in 2011 (see Project ID#58433), and CNPC spent $210 million in 2013 on a road that leads to the Soraz Oil Refinery (see Project ID#31046). 3. The CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan is not captured in the Chinese Loans to Africa Database developed by SAIS-CARI and maintained by the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University. 4. The face value of the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan is unknown. However, given that the total cost of the Niger Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project is $1.3 billion and CNPC Finance (HK) Limited agreed to finance 80% of the project cost with debt, AidData assumes that the face value of the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan was roughly equivalent to $1.04 billion. This issue warrants further investigation. Further research is also needed to determine if the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited was supported by any credit enhancements.  5.  Africa Energy Intelligence identifies CNPC Finance (HK) Limited as the lender. 6. A feasibility study for the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project — undertaken by the China Petroleum Planning and Engineering Institute (CPPEI) and the China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CPPE) — recommended that CPFHK lend at an interest rate between 7.9% and 8.2%. As such, AidData has estimated the loan’s interest rate by taking the midpoint of this range (8.05%). 7. The precise financial commitment (loan signing) date is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes a commitment year of 2019 since this was the first year of project implementation. 8. According to the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, Niger owed FDI debt of $2.5 billion to Chinese residents in 2019 and $5 billion in 2020 (https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=60564261).  9. Relevant project contacts include Kabirou Zakari, the Director of Hydrocarbons at the Nigerien Ministry of Oil and Nafiou Issaka, the Deputy General Manager of WAPCo-Niger. 10. According to an April 2022 World Bank publication (https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099605105092251771/pdf/P17725409626890c00921f0697c07bec87e.pdf), the Government of Niger holds a 15% ownership stake in WAPCo-Niger (worth 2.4% of GDP or approximately $372 million). An earlier IMF report (from January 2020) noted that the pipeline ‘will be majority owned by CNPC with the state of Niger having the option to buy into its equity. Such participation would entitle the state to a revenue stream in foreign currency that could be used to service any foreign debt that may be contracted to finance its investment.’ 11.  A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 12.

85628,"China Development Bank provides $629 million loan for Phase 1 of Lekki Deep Water Port Project On April 21, 2011, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited (LPLEL) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Lekki Port Investment Holding Inc. (75% equity stake) that is itself jointly owned by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (52.50% equity stake) and Tolaram (22.5% equity stake), Lagos State Government (20% equity stake), and the Nigerian Ports Authority (5% equity stake) — signed a concession agreement for the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. LPLEL was awarded a 45-year concession on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis. It is responsible, under the terms of the concession agreement to develop, finance, build, operate and, at the end of the concession term, transferring the Lekki Deep Water Port (located in the Lagos Free Trade Zone) to NPA. LPLEL will earn revenues through operations of the port.   Upon completion, Lekki Port is expected to have a total of 3 container berths, 1 dry bulk berth and 3 liquid berths. The port is projected to have the capacity to handle about 5.5 million containers and estimated to generate 200,000 direct and indirect jobs in the economy. It is also expected to generate over $361 billion over the 45-year concession period with the Government of Nigeria earning about $200 billion. CMA Terminals Nigeria, a subsidiary of French shipping company CMA CGM, which it jointly owns with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), will operate the port once it opens in 2022, following the signing of a sub-concession agreement on September 30, 2019.  On October 23, 2019, China Development Bank (CDB) and LPLEL signed a long-term, $629 million commercial loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#85628) were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $679 million commercial (EPC) contract with CHEC, which was signed on May 11, 2012. On the same day, CDB and Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited signed a Sponsor Support Agreement, Completion Guarantee Agreement and the Tripartite Keep well Agreement as well as seven security documents.   The total cost of Phase 1 is $1.043 billion. CHEC made a $221,047,248 direct equity investment in Phase 1 of the project on March 30, 2020 (captured via Project ID#87054). The first, $60 million CDB loan tranche was disbursed on April 29, 2021 after Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited had satisfied all the conditions precedent for the release of the funds. Additional debt financing was reportedly provided by Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD), European Investment Bank, FMO, IFC, African Finance Corporation, DEG, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Chartered, and Stanbic Bank.  CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 29, 2018. Phase 1 construction activities commenced on June 15, 2020. Then, in October 2020, construction of a 680 meter long quay wall commenced, with the driving of the first sets of piles underway. Speaking at the flag-off ceremony at the project site, the Chief Executive Officer of Lekki Port, Mr. Ruogang Du, said that the commencement of piling of the quay wall, which is a major phase of the construction, symbolized a significant step towards the timely delivery of the project. In late November 2020, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, Nigeria’s Minister of Transportation directed Dr. Magdalene Ajani, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, and the legal department to document an agreement with the Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Ltd., to ensure that the port becomes operational in 2022. The Minister of Transportation gave this directive while inspecting the project.    In late March 2021, it was announced that the project had achieved a 48% completion rate and would begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2023. In early May 2021, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited announced that construction of the Lekki Deep Seaport had reached a nearly 50% completion rate. At that time, the 1,909 meter long core of the main breakwater was completed, and work on the quay wall and landside infrastructure has reached advanced stages. This milestone of the completion of the core of the main breakwater was achieved on April 29, 2021. The Managing Director, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited, Mr. Du Ruogang, affirmed that construction would be completed as scheduled (with a planned completion date of September 2022) and a targeted commercial operations date in Q4 2022. He also affirmed that the container terminal operator – Lekki Freeport Terminal, a subsidiary of CMA/CGM — was ready to commence operations (under a bespoke sub-concession arrangement) once construction was complete. In early August 2021, it was announced that the Lekki Deep Sea Port Project was moving forward according to schedule with 58.15% of the construction works having been completed. Phase 1 was ultimately completed when a project handover certificate was issued on October 24, 2022. Upon completion, it was originally expected that Phase 1 would increase the port’s handling capacity by 1.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). Phase 2 is expected to more than double this total to 2.5 TEUs. 1. The Chinese project title is 中国港湾尼日利亚莱基港项目 or 尼日利亚莱基港项目 or 尼日利亚莱基深水港项目 or 尼日利亚莱基深水港项目. 2. AidData has coded this loan as collateralized due to the fact that CDB and Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited signed several ’security documents’ on October 23, 2019. 3. The total project cost was put at $1.7 billion in March 2015, as previously reported by IJGlobal and at the time the timing of the project financing was in doubt due to a disagreement between the lead developer and the Government of Nigeria, acting through one of the stakeholders Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). At that time, six lenders – a mixture of DFIs and commercial banks – had been lined up by Tolaram Group but government approval was delayed by the 2015 federal elections. Four years and two elections later, the port had received enough funds to bring the first phase into the construction period, China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) beat other 19 other bidders in the tender for the project’s first phase. 4. Legal counsel to CDB included Linklaters and Aluko & Oyebode. Legal counsel to the project sponsors included Allen & Overy and Templars.5. The container operations of the port were sub-concessioned by Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited (LPLEL) to Lekki Freeport Terminals LFZ Enterprise, a subsidiary of CMA CGM Group (a world leader in maritime transport). Lekki Freeport Terminals LFZ Enterprise, a joint venture with China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC), will operate the container terminal pursuant to a sub-concession agreement signed in September 2019.6. Given that CDB agreed to provide a loan to finance approximately 90% of the cost of the EPC contract, AidData assumes that the loan was issued in the form of a buyer's credit. This issue warrants further investigation. ",False,0.40804031

The $1.215 billion project was also supported by the World Bank ($350 million), commercial financing ($660 million), and the Government of Nigeria ($5 million).   Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP) is a Federal Government of Nigeria initiative that is private sector driven and seeks to provide electricity access to households, micro, small and medium enterprises in off grid communities across the country through renewable power sources. NEP is being implemented by the country’s Rural Electrification Agency (REA) in collaboration with the World Bank and it aims to be the largest off-grid electrification project across 250 communities in 4 states (Niger, Ogun, Sokoto and Cross River). The project will seek to provide electricity to households, small-to-medium-sized enterprises, and public institutions in a least-cost and timely manner through off- and mini-grid solutions. NEP’s objective is to provide over 500,000 people with access to affordable sources of electricity.   The specific objectives of the project are are to (a) increase electricity access to households and micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs); (b) provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity through renewable power sources to unserved and underserved rural communities; (c) develop a data driven off-grid model for Nigeria that will become an exemplar for Sub-Saharan Africa; and (d) provide reliable power supply for 250,000 (MSMEs) and 1 million households. The project has 4 components:   (1) Solar Hybrid Mini Grids: Partial grant support will be provided to support the development of private sector mini grids in unserved areas to electrify households, local enterprises, and public institutions. This component includes a minimum subsidy tender to electrify selected communities that have high economic growth potential, and a performance-based grant program that developers may use to electrify the communities of their choice.   (2) Standalone Solar Systems (SHS): Market-based incentives and technical assistance will be provided to standalone solar system providers to install solar home systems to help millions of underserved Nigerian households and enterprises. With this, Nigerians will access clean, safe and reliable energy services from private companies at a lower cost.   (3) Energizing Education Programme (EEP): The overall objective of this component is to provide reliable, affordable and sustainable power to universities and associated teaching hospitals. This EEP’s scope is 37 federal universities and 7 associated university teaching hospitals across the country, serving approximately 120,000 people. These learning institutions will be powered by electricity generation systems of 1 MW to 11 MW that can operate either isolated from the grid or connected to the grid.   (4) Technical Assistance: The provision of technical assistance will support project implementation and broad capacity building in the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing and the Rural Electrification Agency. It will also finance project implementation as well as help build a framework for rural electrification.    As of June 2020, AfDB provided the following NEP implementation summary: ‘Due to [a delayed] project start up, NEP has suffered from procurement implementation delays and slow disbursement.

The hedge interest rate payable by Transnet was 3-month JIBAR + 3.79%, and the hedge interest rate receivable by Transnet was 3-month LIBOR + 2.57%. As calculated from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the average 3-month JIBAR over 2019 was 4.76%, so at the time of signing the hedge interest rate payable was 8.55%. In this time period, the average 3-month LIBOR over 2019 was 2.327%, so at the time of signing the hedge interest rate receivable was 4.897%. Payments on the loan would be made quarterly until June 12, 2030. The JPMorgan Chase Bank branch in Johannesburg will act as the hedge counterparty to hedge against interest liabilities. Time of signing for the swap is unknown, coder used 3M average monthly 2019 JIBAR and LIBOR.The Annual Financial Report for 2019 differs from the 2020 report in reporting the loan to have a nominal value of 21 million USD instead of 20 million; the latter is used as it was a more recent source.",False,0.06859745

59619,"China Eximbank provides $736 million loan for Phase 1 of 392 km Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#59617) In July 2016, South Sudan’s Foreign Minister Deng Alor Kuol made an official visit to China and requested a $1.9 billion China Eximbank loan to develop oil fields and rebuild a road between Juba, the capital, and Wau. Then, in August 2016, Mawien Makol Arik, the Spokesman for South Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that China Eximbank was ‘working on this loan’. Then, in 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of South Sudan signed an oil-backed lending framework agreement to finance multiple road construction projects that would link the capital city of Juba to the remote countryside. Shandong Hi-Speed Group Co., Ltd (SDHS) was identified as the general EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of these projects. Then, on March 25, 2019, SDHS, China Eximbank, South Sudan’s Ministry of Finance and Planning, and South Sudan’s Ministry of Petroleum signed a multi-party agreement. Under the terms of the multi-party agreement, the Government of South Sudan agreed to deposit the proceeds from the sale of 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil into a lender-controlled escrow (special) account in order to meet its repayment obligations to China Eximbank and facilitate payments to SDHS for work performed on EPC contracts for road projects. At that time, the Government of South Sudan was producing 140,000 bpd. Then, on May 7, 2019, the Government of South Sudan issued a resolution (No.46/2019) in which it identified the nine road projects that it intended to finance through its so-called ‘oil-for-roads’ program. The Government of South Sudan then authorized at least four oil revenue transfers to the oil-for-roads program: a transfer in Fiscal Year 2019-2020 (July 1, 2019-June 30, 2020) worth approximately $82,000,000, a transfer in Fiscal Year 2020-2021 (July 1, 2020-June 30, 2021) worth approximately SSP 45 billion ($345,600,000), a transfer in Fiscal Year 2021-2022 (July 1, 2021-June 30, 2022) worth approximately SSP 184 billion ($1,413,200,000), and a transfer in Fiscal Year 2022-2023 (July 1, 2022-June 30, 2023) worth approximately SSP 238.2 billion ($1,829,376,000). The cumulative estimated value of these four oil revenue transfers is $3,670,176,000. According to an April 2021 report delivered to the U.N. Security Council, the Government of South Sudan had financed four road construction projects (via four separate commercial contracts worth $3.87 billion through the ‘oil-for-roads’ program as of early 2021.   The purpose of the China Eximbank-financed Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Project (also known as the Juba-Bahr el Ghazal Highway Project), which is captured via Project ID#59619, is to construct a 392 kilometer stretch of National No. 1 road — with 11 modern standard bridges, 35 box culverts, 300 pipeline culverts, and 21 viaducts — that runs from Juba to Terekeka and Mingkaman and then to Yirol and onward to Rumbek. The road consists of 4 sections: (1) Juba-Terekeka; (2) Terekeka-Mingkaman, (3) Mingkaman-Yirol, and (4) Yirol-Rumbek. On March 25, 2019, Shandong Hi-Speed Group Co., Ltd (SDHS) and the South Sudan Ministry of Roads and Bridges signed an $711 million commercial (EPC) contract for the 392 km Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Construction Project. The EPC contract was rescoped in 2022 and its value increased to $736,533,725. At the time of the rescoping, Michael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan’s Minister of Information and Broadcasting, said that ‘[u]pon thorough studies, [a] committee discovered that there were some items which were missing, bridges were missing, and crossing points were also missing including compensation for those who will be affected by the construction of the road.’ The Government of South Sudan reportedly borrowed $711 million from China Eximbank to facilitate the implementation of this project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. SDHS is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.  On December 13, 2014, a formal groundbreaking ceremony for the project was held. However, in July 2016, the project was temporarily suspended after a resurgence of violence in South Sudan. The project recommenced implementation on October 11, 2019, and it was expected to take 36 months from that date to reach completion (October 11, 2022). Construction was temporarily suspended in June 2020 over quality concerns – after a heavy downpour swept away some unpaved sections of the road on May 23, 2020. A group of South Sudanese lawyers threatened to sue the Ministry of Roads and SDHS for ‘shoddy work’ and demanded that the commercial contract for the Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Construction Project be made public. The Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan, Hua Ning, subsequently said that SDHS would make the necessary changes to improve the quality of the highway. At that time, South Sudan Minister of Roads and Bridges Simon Mijok Mijak referred to the local subsidiary of SDHS (Shandong Hi-speed Nile Investment and Development Co., Ltd,) as ‘an inexperienced company.’  Benjamin Manyiel, the head of Liberty Engineering, a consultancy firm appraising the work on the road project, also said that delays by the Government of South Sudan to hire a consultancy firm slowed down implementation. After undertaking a review of the 392 km Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek road project that lasted about three months, the Government of South Sudan granted SDHS permission to resume work in January 2021. One month earlier (December 2020), SDHS and the Government of South Sudan’s Ministry of Road and Bridges came to agreement that 80 percent of the project workforce should be sourced locally to ensure compliance with South Sudan's Labor Act of 2017. The project’s first phase — a 63 km road section from Juba to Terekeka — had achieved a 75% completion rate as of November 2021. Then, in October 2022, Simon Mijok Mijak, the national minister of roads and bridges, announced that ‘we are determined to deliver this project to the people of South Sudan.’ He also announced that the project was expected to reach completion within three years (October 2025). Ma Qiang, the Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan, also announced in October 2022 that the construction of the ‘first section’ of the 392 km Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek road — a 63 km section from Juba to Terekeka — had reached completion. He noted that ‘[t]his road is of high standard and quality, and it’s the first modern highway in this country; it tends to take only 40 minutes to drive from Juba to Terekeka.’  There has been some controversy about the way in which the Government of South Sudan will meet its repayment obligations to China Eximbank. In May 2019, South Sudan's Undersecretary in the Ministry of Petroleum reported that his government had completed the shipment of the first cargo of crude oil to fund the construction of the Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Project. Then, in June 2019, the Government of South Sudan revoked an earlier decision in which it entrusted the Ministry of Petroleum with responsibility for depositing funds in the China Eximbank-controlled escrow account. It turned this responsibility over to the country’s central bank, the Bank of South Sudan. South Sudan’s Information Minister, Michael Makuei, at the time that ‘the [proceeds] received from the sale [of oil] will go directly to the Central Bank, the Central Bank will then transfer the money to Exim Bank in China. This is to avoid any crooked dealings in the oil industry.’ Makuei said the decision would take the responsibility of dealing with finances away from the Ministry of Petroleum: ‘The Ministry of Petroleum is not a spending agency but a revenue-generating institution.’ Then, on December 19, 2019, when South Sudan's Ministry of Finance released its FY 2019-2020 Approved Budget Book, it acknowledged that 'the necessary condition of 30,000 barrels per day deduction [...] has fundamentally changed [...] short term conditions for the South Sudan economy’ and that the 30,000 barrels per day deduction ‘creates large deficits in the budget and in the balance of payments, which has to be met by cuts in imports and public expenditure […].’ A 2021 report published by International Crisis Group claimed that the Government of South Sudan could only ‘afford to fund the project with 10,000 barrels per day’ and its ‘opaque [oil-backed loan agreement] shields substantial revenues from oversight and has already led to scandal, including accusations of mismanagement and corruption.’ President Kiir sacked his Minister for Presidential Affairs, Mayiik Ayii Deng, in June 2020 due to alleged mismanagement of the Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Construction Project amid an uproar over the poor quality of road construction. However, President Kiir reappointed Mayiik Ayii as foreign minister in September 2021.  As of October 2022, reports suggest that the Government of South Sudan was honoring its commitment to sell 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day to China in order to facilitate the continued implementation of the 392km Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Project.  Another source of controversy is the fact that South Sudan President Salva Kiir Mayardit set up a ‘China desk’ within the Office of the President to oversee the project and the broader oil-backed lending framework agreement with China Eximbank. According to a 2021 report from a Panel of Experts on South Sudan prepared for the U.N. Security Council, ‘[t]he Office of the President has directly managed the negotiation and implementation of the road construction projects since the Council of Ministers agreed, in May 2019, to allocate 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day for the development of infrastructure […]. Current and former government officials have told the Panel that, because the Office of the President created a special “desk” to manage the projects directly, there has been no government oversight. The normal review of the technical aspects of the roads has not been conducted by the Ministry of Roads and Bridges, and financial transparency with regard to payments for the projects has been lacking from the Ministry of Finance and Planning’.  Descriptions of the 9 additional road projects financed via — or scheduled for financing — via the Government of South Sudan’s oil-for-roads program are provided below:  (1) The Rumbek-Bentiu-Malakal Road Project: The purpose of the project is to construct a road from Rumbek to Malakal via Bentiu.  (2) The Nadapal-Kapoeta-Torit-Juba-Bor-Ayod-Malakal-Renk Road Project: The purpose of this project is to construct a 539 km road from Nadapal to Renk via Kapoeta, Torit, Juba, Bor, Ayod, and Malakal. The Government of South Sudan awarded a three year, $1.04 billion commercial (EPC) contract to ARC Resources Corporation Limited (ARC Resources) for the 204 km Juba-Bor-Malakal road segment based on a single source bid that was not publicized. ARC Resources reportedly failed to submit a feasibility study on the potential social and environmental impacts of the road project. In March 2020, ARC Resources began construction. As of late October 2020, less than 20 km of paved road had been completed. Based on the terms of the contract and confidential sources familiar with the project, ARC Resources received upfront financing for the project that has not been reflected in the Ministry of Finance and Planning budget figures. A United Nations Security Council Panel of Experts has reviewed confidential documentation that indicates that ARC Resources received an advanced payment of at least $100 million for the project. The Panel of Experts also reviewed documentation confirming that, in February 2020, the Government of South Sudan awarded a separate oil-backed contract — without a competitive tender — for the construction of the 365 km Juba-Torit-Nadapal road section to Winners Construction Company Ltd. Construction started on the Juba-Torit-Nadapal road in August 2020. Then, in late 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it had ‘designated ARC Resources Corporation Limited (ARC Resources) and Winners Construction Company Limited (Winners) for being owned or controlled by Benjamin Bol Mel (Bol Mel), an individual included in the Annex of E.O. 13818 in December 2017.’ In a public statement, it said that ‘Bol Mel previously oversaw ABMC Thai-South Sudan Construction Company Limited (ABMC), which was awarded contracts worth tens of millions of dollars by the Government of South Sudan (GoSS) and allegedly received preferential treatment from high-level GoSS officials in a non-competitive process for selecting ABMC to do roadwork throughout South Sudan. ARC Resources is linked to ABMC, and has been used by senior members of GoSS for laundering money.’ It further claimed that ARC Resources and Winners have been used to evade sanctions and travel restrictions on Bol Mel, and have been awarded noncompetitive and substantial oil-backed contracts from the GoSS for road construction. It added that ‘ARC Resources and Winners are designated pursuant to E.O. 13818 for being owned or controlled by, directly or indirectly, Bol Mel, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13818.’  (3) The Juba-Mundri-Maridi-Yambio-Tambura (Tamura)-Wau Road Project: This project involves the construction of an 890 km road from Juba to Wau via Mundri, Maridi, Yambio, and Tambura (Tamura). The ultimate objective of the project is to connect Juba with the other States of Western Equatoria State, Western Bahr-el-Ghazal including Lakes State. The project will seek to tarmack the Juba, Mundri-Yambio (WES) and Yambio-Wau (WBS) Road and Mundri-Rumbek in Lakes State. ARC Resources Corporation Limited (ARC Resources) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on June 22, 2022.   (4) The Kaya-Yei-Juba Road Project: The purpose of this project is to construct a 219 km road from Kaya to Juba via Yei. Sanco, an Egyptian construction company, and ARC Resources Corporation Limited (ARC Resources) are reportedly responsible for project implementation. The project was halted in mid-2020 due to a decline in oil prices. In September 2022, Aggrey Cyrus Kanyikwa, Yei River County Commissioner, complained that the national government had still not released the funds necessary to complete the project.   (5) The Sobat Bridge and the East-West Bridge Near Malakal in the Former Greater Upper Nile Project: The purpose of this project is to construct Sobat Bridge and the East-West Bridge near the city of Malakal.  (6) The Wau-Raga Road Project: The purpose of this project is to construct a road from Wau, the capital of Western Bahr el Ghazal State (formerly Wau State), to the town of Raga (within Raja County in Western Bahr el-Ghazal State).  (7) The Gogrial-Twic-Abyei-Bentiu Road Project: The purpose of this project is to construct a road from Gogrial to Bentiu via Twic and Abyei.  (8) The Wau-Aweil (Awerial) Road Project. The purpose of the project is to construct a stretch of National No. 1 road that runs from Wau (in Western Bahr el Ghazal State) to Aweil (Awerial). The estimated cost of this project is $750 million.   (9) The Western Equatoria-Raja Road Project. The purpose of this project is to construct a 451 km road from Western Equatoria to Raja Road.   More research is needed to determine if any of these projects were financed by China Eximbank (through the multi-party agreement or otherwise). 1. The Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek Road Project is also known as the National No. 1 Road Project, the Juba-Bahr el Ghazal Highway Project, the Juba-Terekeka-Yirol-Rumbek-Wau-Gogrial-Aweil (Awerial) Road Project, and the Juba-Rumbek Road Project.

Phase 1 was ultimately completed in 2013, but its precise completion date is unknown.    Then, on August 25, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed an RMB 1,360,000,000 ($218.9 million) GCL agreement with China Eximbank for Phase 2 of the NetOne Expansion Project (captured in Project ID#62426). This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 5 year grace period. The Phase 2 GCL’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $229,411,424.25 as of 2021. Phase 2 involved an expansion in the number of base stations from 400 in 2013 to 2,300 in 2016. It was completed on September 10, 2015, and Huawei Technologies was responsible for its implementation.   On June 26, 2019, the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank signed an RMB 485 million ($71 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase 3 of the NetOne Expansion Project (captured via Project ID#52620). The Phase 3 GCL, which was ratified by Zimbabwe’s Parliament in December 2019, carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity period, and a 5 year grace period. The loan proceeds are reportedly ‘ring-fenced’ in an escrow account that is jointly monitored by the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank and were on-lent to NetOne. Phase 3 involves the installation of 3,000 additional base stations in 500 new sites, and Huawei Technologies will be responsible for its implementation. In 2020, an initial disbursement of $21.3 million was made through the RMB 485 million ($71 million) GCL. Then, in between January 2022 and September 2022, China Eximbank disbursed an additional $4.6 million. There are some signs that at least one of the GCLs issued by China Eximbank for the NetOne Expansion Project have financially underperformed. In mid-2022, the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance released a report, which noted that ‘[t]he low disbursements of loans is due to accumulation of arrears to active China Eximbank loans […] on projects such as the Victoria Falls International Airport ($54 million), NetOne network expansion ($61 million) and expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport ($3 million).’    By the end of 2021, total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G.

65402,"ICBC provides $1.2891 billion buyer's credit loan for New Angola International Airport (NAIA) Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#65524, #72349) On May 9, 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Government of Angola signed a USD 1.2891 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the New Angola International Airport (NAIA) Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, an 18-month grace period, and an unknown interest rate. It is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a USD 1.51 billion commercial contract between Angola’s Ministry of Transportation (MINTRANS) and China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (AVIC-ENG).   The purpose of the project is to construct and equip the New Angola International Airport (NAIA), which is located approximately 40 km to the southeast of the centre of Luanda, in the Bom Jesus commune, Icole e Bengo municipality in Luanda Province. The airport is designed to be an alternative to the existing Quatro de Fevereiro Airport, another international airport that serves Luanda. The new airport is being designed to have an annual capacity of 15 million passengers and 600,000 tons of cargo, with a 4,200 meter runway and 3,800 meter runway, and a 160,000 square meter terminal. The airport will also have 12 aircraft docks, a VIP passenger terminal, and an air traffic control tower.   China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (AVIC-ENG) is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction on this project began in 2007 under the management of the China International Fund (CIF); however, in February 2019, the Angolan Government announced that it had cancelled the contract with CIF. CIF was replaced by AVIC-Eng. Other contractors and suppliers involved in the project are Metallurgical Corporation of China (CTMCC), Dalian Zongyi Science & Technology Development, Fangda New Materials (Jiangxi), and Beijing Urban Construction Exploration & Surveying Design Research Institute. Angola's Ministry of Transportation (MoT) also appointed Mace Engineering Group as project manager and site supervisor for the project on March 27, 2015.   As of August 2019, the project had achieved a 60% completion rate, with plans to commission the airport in 2022. However, due to financial problems, work on the project was halted in 2019. Then, at the second Ordinary Session of the Cabinet Council, held on February 28, 2019, Angola’s Ministry of Transport was directed to conduct technical and financial review of the project in order to guarantee its completion, ensure better alignment with various ministerial departments, and establish a new schedule of actions. Then, in May, 2020, an addendum to the commercial contract between AVIC-Eng and MINTRANS was signed. At the same time, the parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as part of the technical review work to adapt the quality and operational parameters of the new airport.   Work resumed on May 17, 2021. Then, on June 17, 2022, the airport organized its first test flight as part of a certification process and it was officially renamed Agostinho Neto International Airport. The project is now scheduled for completion on December 31, 2023. In 2017, China Development Bank reportedly also issued a loan for the New Luanda International Airport Construction Project (see Project ID#72349) but it was apparently replaced by the ICBC loan that is captured via Project ID#65402.

According to the Government of Cameroon's Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements (CAA), the loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 3 year grace period, a 15 year maturity, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Cameroon’s Délégation Générale à la Sûreté Nationale (DGSN or General Delegation for National Security) and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed in February 2017. As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 22.4 billion.   The project involves the installation of 1,500 video-surveillance cameras in various cities and towns and the acquisition of 2,000 portable two-way radios. During phase 1 of the project, video-surveillance cameras will be installed in the capital cities of the country’s ten regions (Ngaoundere, Yaoundé, Bertoua, Maroua, Douala, Garoua, Bamenda, Bafoussam, Ebolowa, and Buea) as well as the towns of Kribi, Kyé-Ossi. Garoua-Boulaï, Waza, Fotokol, Kousseri and Amchidé. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. This project has entered implementation.

85712,"ICBC contributes to EUR 172 million syndicated loan tranche for 420MW Nachtigal Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project The EUR 1.26 billion Nachtigal Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project is an independent power project (IPP) that is being implemented on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a 76:24 debt-to-equity ratio. On November 8, 2018, Nachtigal Hydro Power Company (NHPC) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of Republic of Cameroon (30% equity stake), EDF International SAS - EDFI (40% equity stake) and the International Finance Corporation (30% equity stake) — signed an EUR 912 million syndicated loan agreement with a group of banks for the 420MW Nachtigal Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The loan has two tranches: an 18-year, EUR 693.4 million ($794.5 million) development finance institution (DFI) tranche from Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), African Development Bank, Agence Française de Développement, CDC Group, European Investment Bank, DEG, Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund, European Investment Bank, FMO, International Finance Corp, KfW, OPEC Fund for International Development and Proparco; and a 7-year, EUR 171 million ($200 million) commercial (CFA Franc-denominated) tranche from Banque Internationale du Cameroun pour l'Epargne et le Crédit, Société Générale Cameroun, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Standard Chartered Bank Cameroon and Société Commerciale de Banque Cameroun. The project sponsors also agreed to provide EUR 289 million in equity contributions and they applied for MIGA guarantees totaling EUR 191.5 million for up to 15 years against breach of contract risk. The project achieved ‘financial close’ on December 24, 2018.   The purpose of the project is to construct the 420MW Nachtigal hydroelectric plant on the Sanaga river (the first IPP to be built on the Sanaga river). The run-of-the-river project, which also includes a 50 km transmission line and a 3km supply canal, will be built under a 35-year concession agreement with the Cameroonian government. The project site located approximately 65 km north-east of Yaoundé. Interest in the Nachtigal Amont site emerged as early as 1965 during the first inventory of the Sanaga River hydropower potential. Since then, several studies were conducted by various developers to understand the site potential. In 2013, a joint development agreement was signed between IFC, EDF, Rio Tinto Alcan Inc., and the Republic of Cameroon to develop the project. Upon completion, the power plant will be connected to the country’s Southern Interconnected Grid (SIG), which transmits about 94 percent of the national electricity consumed and comprises major cities like Yaoundé and Douala. Thanks to its unique site and hydrology, the project is expected to generate on average 2,900 GWh per annum. The project layout includes a 1,455-meter-long, 13.6-meter-high main dam in roller compacted concrete, creating a structure of 27.8 hm3 . The site also includes a 421-ha upstream reservoir, a concrete lined headrace channel about 3.3 km long and 14-meter-deep on average to conduct water to the hydroelectric power plant, with a maximum flow rate of 980 m3 /s corresponding to the project design flow. The powerhouse is equipped with seven Francis generating units of 60 MW each. The Nachtigal Project also comprises a 225-kV substation and a double circuit 50.3 km transmission line to evacuate the power produced to the Nyom 2 connection substation.   The project will be ‘developed in compliance with national and international best practices in terms of environmental and social management and infrastructure building’, according to a statement released by the AFC. The project is expected to cause environmental and social impacts that may be significant and irreversible both during construction and operation; however, the project design seeks to ensure that these impacts will be monitored and mitigated as much as possible. NHPC set up a dedicated team to implement the recommendations of and monitor the environment and social management plan (ESMP) throughout the lifecycle of the project. During construction, the project owner’s engineer will be mandated to have a continuous presence on site, to closely monitor the implementation of the ESMP and environment and social (E&S) contractual obligations by contractors, and address any shortcomings. The project owner’s engineer will have the authority to stop the work on site, instruct the contractors to implement mitigation measures through work orders and impose financial penalties on the contractors in case of non-compliance. Its activities will be regularly reviewed by an independent E&S advisor, as well as directly by the Republic of Cameroon, through the IDA-financed Sanaga River Hydropower Technical Assistance Project (P157733), which will fund a Panel of Experts (PoE). As per Cameroonian law, NHPC will be required to create a Social Dialogue Committee, which includes representation from NHPC, EPC contractors, relevant authorities, and workers, to address issues raised by workers on the construction site.   Besix is lead EPC contractor for the civil works and is partnered by NGE and Societe Generale des Travaux du Maroc (SGTM). Electromechanical works are being provided by GE Hydro France (a subsidiary of GE Renewable Energy, and one of the Alstom power businesses acquired by GE Power in 2015) and Elecnor. Bouygues has the EPC contract for the transmission line.  NHPC was granted the 35-year exclusive right to design, build, operate and transfer the project under a concession agreement signed with Republic of Cameroon in 2017. NHPC and ENEO subsequently signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for 35 years. ENEO will be sole offtaker for the project under the 35-year take-or-pay PPA with a levelized tariff of €0.061 per kWh (and payments will be made in Central African Francs, 80% of which will be indexed to euros). ENEO’s integral role in the deal meant a restructuring of its debts and the lengthening of its concession by 10 years to 2031 to enable it to invest in upgrading the grid (current technical and commercial losses are around 30%). The project was originally scheduled to commence on October 1, 2018 and concluded on June 30, 2024. However, construction did not begin until February 1, 2019. The project has faced moderate implementation delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As of May 2022, the implementation of the ESMP had achieved a 30% progress rate and the revised target commercial operation date (COD) of the Nachtigal hydropower plant was August 2024. 1. The seven-year tranche is designed to offset currency risk, with an option to extend twice to 21 years, and is covered by an up to 21-year IBRD partial risk guarantee. The IBRD loan guarantee is designed to provide comfort to local commercial lenders, thereby allowing them to extend the tenor of their loans beyond the seven-year regulatory limit. IBRD is also providing a stand-by letter of credit for the sponsors. 2. The size of ICBC’s contribution to the EUR 171 million  syndicated loan tranche is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that all 5 members of the syndicate made equal contributions (EUR 34.3 million). 3. The Republic of Cameroon informed all parties of its intention to sell down half of its stake in NHPC (15 percent), which was created on July 7, 2016, at or around financial close to Africa50 Project Finance. Africa50 Project Finance is an investment platform owned by 25 African government, two central banks and the African Development Bank. After financial close, the Republic of Cameroon honored its commitment.  STOA – an EUR 600 million joint investment fund founded in 2017 by AFD and Caisse des Depots – and pan-African fund Africa50 (founded by the AfDB) both bought stakes in the SPV from the Cameroon Government. 4. As global coordinator of a large syndicate of 11 DFIs and five local commercial banks, IFC played an anchor role in mobilizing long-term financing. 5. Individual contributions to the DFI tranche include EIB (€50 million), AfDB (€118 million), Africa Finance Corporation (€50 million), AFD (€90 million), CDC (€90 million), DEG (€35 million), PIDG/EAIF (€50 million), FMO (€30 million), OFID (€50 million) and Proparco (€60 million). 6. EDFI is a holding company comprising EDF’s investments outside of France. EDF is a French utility involved in all segments of the energy value chain: generation, transmission, distribution, energy supply, and trading with a portfolio of more than 130 GW of generation capacity spread throughout Europe, South America, North America, and Asia. EDF is Europe’s largest renewable energy producer and has an extensive footprint in the hydropower sector. EDF had total revenues of EUR 69.6 billion in 2017 and is currently rated A-, A3, and A- by S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch, respectively. 7. This project does create a contingent public sector liability. The contingent liability arising from the project consists of the guarantee provided by the Republic of Cameroon to backstop ENEO’s payment obligation (a guarantee which will be secured by an IBRD-guaranteed revolving L/C in the amount of EUR 86 million, for which the Republic of Cameroon is the reimbursement obligor) and the Republic of Cameroon’s obligation to pay termination compensation to NHPC in the case of early termination of core Project agreements, a customary market-standard protection that is reportedly indispensable to the project’s bankability. 8.

According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), as of April 2022, 17 loan disbursements (worth CFA 81,378,912,345) had been made: a CFA 24,255,398,726 disbursement on March 31, 2019, a CFA 2,328,504,363 disbursement on July 31, 2019, a CFA 267,708,719 disbursement on August 31, 2019, a CFA 1,497,918,884 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a CFA 1,644,198,692 disbursement on November 30, 2019, a CFA 6,988,667,300 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 1,799,219,878 disbursement on February 28, 2020, a CFA 2,545,593,567 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a CFA 1,865,655,329 disbursement on April 30, 2020, a CFA 2,018,475,154 disbursement on May 31, 2020, a CFA 1,099,120,168 disbursement on June 30, 2010, a CFA 1,311,146,676 disbursement on July 31, 2020, a CFA 769,209,524 disbursement on August 31, 2020, a CFA 3,048,153,031 disbursement on December 31, 2020, a CFA 1,062,845,867 disbursement on March 31, 2021, a CFA 5,680,700,701 disbursement on April 30, 2021, and a CFA 15,521,452,065 disbursement on June 30, 2021.  The purpose of this project is to construct a 96 km section of the two-way, four-lane, Northern Highway (Autoroute du Nord or l’Autoroute Abidjan-Frontière Nord or 北部公路) — with a design speed of 130 km per hour — between Tiébissou and Bouaké. The Tiebissou-Bouake road section consists of three subsections (known as ‘lots’): a 35 km subsection (29+450 at PK 64+450 or ‘Lot 1’); a 13.9 km subsection (known as 64+450 at PK 78+350) and a 11.726 km expressway at the entrance of Bouaké to the southern corridor (‘Lot 2’); and a 35 km subsection (78+350 at PK 113+350 or ‘Lot 3’). It also involves the construction of six interchanges, two market areas, one fuel station, a toll station, a weighing platform, eight road crossings, ten pedestrian crossings, and nine bridges (three highway bridges and six overpasses). The Tiebissou-Bouake road section is the second component of a larger highway construction project linking the cities of Yamoussoukro and Bouaké (known as the Yamoussoukro-Bouaké Road Construction Project). The first component is a road section between Yamoussoukro and Tiébissou financed by the Islamic Development Bank. The Northern Highway project aims to connect Abidjan, a coastal city on Cote d'Ivoire's southern border, to the northern border shared with Mali.   CRBC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2018, and construction was expected to last 36 months. The Ivorian Minister of Equipment and Road Maintenance completed an on-site project inspection on May 28, 2020. As of September 2020, the project had achieved a 40% completion rate. Then, on May 10, 2021, 400 CRBC workers responsible for the construction of the Tiébissou-Bouaké highway announced a strike to demand better working conditions. Project implementation was further delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of November 26, 2021, more than 400 CRBC employees had received the two doses of the Sinopharm vaccine for COVID-19. The project is expected to reach completion on April 14, 2022.   1.

The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of these loans to finance the $1.239 billion commercial (EPC) contract between Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT), AVIC International, and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group, which was signed on August 15, 2017.   The purpose of the project is to build a Light Rail Transit (LRT) network that extends from El Salam to New Administrative Capital to 10 Ramadan City. The electric light railway will extend 67.8 km (42 miles) from 10th of Ramadan City to Egypt’s New Administrative Capital with 11 stops/stations (in the cities of Salam, Obour, Shorouk, Mostaqbal, Robeiky, and the New Administrative Capital). 61 km of the lines will be above ground, 0.7 km below ground, and 6.1 km will be elevated. Some 7.5 kilometers will be in the form of a bridge, while 0.3 kilometers will be in the form of a tunnel. The speed of the trains will be 120 km/h. The trains will be equipped with non-internal-combustion diesel engines.   The line will start from Adly Mansour Station that is reached by the third metro line, and at Robeiky will be divided into two branches. One will head north in parallel to the Regional Ring Road to the 10th of Ramadan City and the other will head South to the New Administrative Capital. The line will be operated within two years, and will be executed by five Egyptian companies along with the railroads and the fence.  The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) will accomplish the signaling, communication, control, and electricity systems afterwards. It will also manufacture and supply 22 trains. In the second phase, the line will extend to the Sports City near Al-Ain Al-Sokhna so that its length will be 93 kilometers.   The project is intended to reduce the travel time between the 10th of Ramadan City to the New Administrative Capital by about 30%. The realization of the Electric Light Railway Project is expected to reduce traffic, principally on Ismailia highway. Additionally, the project is expected to stimulate Egypt’s construction industry, providing jobs to many.   AVIC International and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group are the general contractors responsible for implementation. Their subcontractors include: (1) a joint venture between TSO and Orascom Construction (for track laying and the construction of 11 stations); (2) Arab Contractors (for construction of Adly Mansour, New Heliopolis and Robaikey stations); (3) Hassan Allam Holding (for construction of the New Government Capital and New Administrative Capital stations); (4) Concord (for construction of Badr and Shorouk stations); (5) Petrojet (for construction of Abour and Future stations); (6) The Holding Co. for Roads, Bridges and Land Transportation Projects (for construction of Industrial Park and Ramadan 1 stations); (7) CRRC Qingdao Sifang (for supply of rolling stock); (8) Consortium of CASCO and China Huaxin (for signaling and communication system); and (9) Siveco China [for supply of Maintenance Management System (MMS)]. In January 2019, China Eximbank reportedly agreed to disburse a $105 million tranche within a month to facilitate the commencement of civil works.   The project was originally expected to begin implementation on January 20, 2019. However, civil works did not commence until May 2019. On October 30, 2020, Egypt’s Transport Minister Kamal El-Wazir conducted an inspection tour of the project. At that time, the project had achieved a 63% completion rate. Bridges were 47% complete, tunnels were 86% complete, and the maintenance workshop was 63% complete. Then, on March 18, 2021, Shenzhen Metro and AVIC International signed a comprehensive joint commissioning service contract for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. The first of 22 trains (manufactured by CRRC Qingdao Sifang) left a port in Shandong in July 2021 and arrived in Egypt on September 7, 2021. As of November 2021, 6 trains had arrived and 95% of construction activities were complete. According to the Egyptian State Information Service, as of May 9, 2022, all 22 trains acquired as part of the project had been received by the Egyptian Ministry of Transportation and they were undergoing testing, with the National Authority for Tunnels confirming that the train line was being 'operated experimentally' as of June 5, 2022. 1.

Then, on August 15, 2017, Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT) signed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract worth $1.239 billion with a consortium consisting of AVIC International and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group, a subsidiary of China Railway Group. Then, on November 5, 2017, at the “BRICS Summit” in Xiamen, China, the Egyptian Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation and China’s Ministry of Commerce signed a MoU on the implementation of the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. On September 1, 2018, two agreements were signed by the Chinese Government and the Egyptian Government in support of the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project: an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), authorizing the provision of an RMB 350 million (approximately $51 million) interest-free loan from China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM); and a government concessional loan (GCL) from China Eximbank worth RMB 4.604 billion (approximately $674 million). Then, on January 15, 2019, the Egyptian House of Representatives passed two government resolutions [Resolution No. 497 (2018) and Resolution No. 496 (2018)], approving the RMB 350 million interest-free loan from MOFCOM and the RMB 4.604 billion loan from China Eximbank.   Multiple sources refer to these two loans (collectively worth an estimated $739 million) as providing the ‘first tranche’ of funding for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. The MOFCOM loan was issued to Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (埃及国家隧道局) and it appears to carry the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a 10 year grace period, and a 0% interest rate. The Government of Egypt issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this loan. The China Eximbank loan was also issued to Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels and it appears to carry the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 1.8% interest rate. It too benefited from a sovereign guarantee.   Then, on January 16, 2019, China Eximbank and Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels signed another loan agreement for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project, which reportedly carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 2 year grace period, 2% interest rate. This loan also benefited from a sovereign guarantee.

(“Nevsun”). Under the terms of the agreement, ENAMCO agreed to purchase a 30% ownership stake in the Bisha Mining Share Company (BMSC) from Nevsun Resources Ltd., which with the Government of Eritrea’s 10% free carried interest brought ENAMCO’s total ownership stake in BMSC to 40%. Then, in November 2007, China Eximbank issued an $80 million commercial loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 1 of Bisha Gold Mine Project.   The proceeds of this loan were use to partially fund ENAMCO’s acquisition of a 30% ownership interest in the Bisha Gold Mine. Then, on July 12, 2010, China Eximbank issued a $60 million follow-on loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 2 of the Bisha Gold Mine Project. The loan agreement for Phase 2 was signed by China Eximbank President Li Ruogu and the Eritrean Minister of Finance Berhane Abrehe It is unknown how the proceeds of this loan were used. The China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 is captured in Project ID#56386 and the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 is captured in Project ID#73371. Construction of the mine began in September 2008 and was completed by 2010. The mine began the commercial production of gold in February 22, 2011, which allowed for an early payback of gold phase capital and allowed for complete funding of both the copper and zinc phase expansions. Then, the mine transitioned from gold production to copper production in late H2 2013 and commenced commercial production of copper in December 2013 and commercial production of zinc in October 2016 following the completion of the zinc expansion project. Then, on August 31, 2018, China Construction Bank Corporation (“CCBC”) issued a binding commitment letter in which it agreed to fully underwrite a $870,000,000 (approximately C$1.1 billion) loan to Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zijin Mining — to facilitate the acquisition of a 55% ownership stake in Nevsun Resources Ltd. (captured via Project ID#89500). This loan carried a 5-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus an unknown margin. Bank of China Limited also committed to provide a credit facility worth up to $660,000,000 (approximately C$834 million) to Zijin Mining to facilitate the acquisition of a 55% ownership stake in Nevsun Resources Ltd (captured via Project ID#89502). Zijin Mining intended to repay all borrowings under the Bank of China loan facility and CCBC loan facility using cash flows from its operations and existing cash on hand. The two principal properties of Nevsun Resources Ltd. were the Timok Project in Serbia, which hosts the copper-gold Cukaru Peki deposit on the Brestovac-Metovnica exploration permit, and the Bisha Project in Eritrea, which hosts the copper-zinc-gold Bisha deposit and includes potential satellite VMS deposits at Harena, Northwest, Hambok and Asheli.

On August 8, 2018 (Beijing Time), Zijin Mining issued a takeover offer proposal to Nevsun. After friendly negotiations between the two parties, Nevsun’s board of directors (“Nevsun’s Board”) consented to support the takeover offer. On September 5, 2018 (Beijing Time), Zijin Mining entered into the Pre-Acquisition Agreement with Nevsun and a Lock-up Agreement with Nevsun’s directors and executive officers. Zijin Mining proposed to make an all cash takeover to acquire all of the Nevsun’s issued common shares which was approximately 302,592,672 common shares (of which, 3,197,191 Nevsun’s common shares were held by Zijin Global Fund, which were managed by a subsidiary of Zijin Mining) and any other common shares that were issued after the date of the offer (including any but prior to the expiry time). The offer price represented a premium of 21% over the closing price of the Nevsun’s common shares on the previous trading day. The total amount of the consideration was approximately CAD $1,839,016,284 (based on the current number of issued common shares and options of Nevsun, assuming all of the options are exercised; excluding the common shares held by Zijin Global Fund), approximately equivalent to RMB 9,530,150,187 or $1.39 billion. 3. On April 30, 2019, Nevsun Resources (Eritrea) Ltd.

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the GCL carries a 2% interest rate. However, the other borrowing terms of the GCL and the interest-free loan are unknown.  Ethiopia’s House of Representatives ratified both loan agreements on April 6, 2019. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the interest-free loan to finance a commercial contract with the Government of Ethiopia and China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, two disbursements took place in 2020: an ETB 274,488,122 disbursement on April 2, 2020, and an ETB 682,257,203 disbursement on September 1, 2020. However, it is unclear if these disbursements took place through the RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599) China Eximbank loan, the RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) MOFCOM loan, or both loans.   This project involves the construction of the Gereb-Giba Dam on the Giba river and the installation of a water pipeline network to supply water to households, industrial parks and factories in and around the city of Mekelle (the capital of Ethiopia's northern Tigray regional state). Upon completion, the project is expected to meet the water needs of the estimated 400,000 residents of Mekelle. It is also expected to generate a maximum storage capacity of 363 million cubic meters during the rainy season, an annual water supply of 53.65 million cubic meters, and an average daily water supply of 124.43 thousand cubic meters. The project was also expected to create 1500 jobs for local people during the construction phase.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 22, 2019. Then, on March 17, 2020, a river closure ceremony took place and dozens of heavy trucks poured dirt and stone into the Giba river. The Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Mr. Tan Jian, and Mr. Debretsion, President of Tigray Regional State attended the closure ceremony, which marked the beginning of a new phase of the project (dam main body filling). Then, on November 11, 2020, after a violent conflict erupted between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Government of Ethiopia, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia evacuated 600 Chinese workers (including CGGC workers assigned to the Mekelle City Water Supply Project) from Tigray State. The originally scheduled project completion date was March 1, 2023.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

Then, on June 13, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599 or $156 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#60762). On the same day, China’s Ministry of Commerce and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) interest-free loan agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#66045). According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the GCL carries a 2% interest rate. However, the other borrowing terms of the GCL and the interest-free loan are unknown. Ethiopia’s House of Representatives ratified both loan agreements on April 6, 2019. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the interest-free loan to finance a commercial contract with the Government of Ethiopia and China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, two disbursements took place in 2020: an ETB 274,488,122 disbursement on April 2, 2020, and an ETB 682,257,203 disbursement on September 1, 2020. However, it is unclear if these disbursements took place through the RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599) China Eximbank loan, the RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) MOFCOM loan, or both loans.   This project involves the construction of the Gereb-Giba Dam on the Giba river and the installation of a water pipeline network to supply water to households, industrial parks and factories in and around the city of Mekelle (the capital of Ethiopia's northern Tigray regional state). Upon completion, the project is expected to meet the water needs of the estimated 400,000 residents of Mekelle. It is also expected to generate a maximum storage capacity of 363 million cubic meters during the rainy season, an annual water supply of 53.65 million cubic meters, and an average daily water supply of 124.43 thousand cubic meters. The project was also expected to create 1500 jobs for local people during the construction phase.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 22, 2019. Then, on March 17, 2020, a river closure ceremony took place and dozens of heavy trucks poured dirt and stone into the Giba river. The Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Mr. Tan Jian, and Mr. Debretsion, President of Tigray Regional State attended the closure ceremony, which marked the beginning of a new phase of the project (dam main body filling). Then, on November 11, 2020, after a violent conflict erupted between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Government of Ethiopia, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia evacuated 600 Chinese workers (including CGGC workers assigned to the Mekelle City Water Supply Project) from Tigray State.

The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that takes place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the off-taker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro. If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account. Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases.   The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinning by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 2), Tamale Interchange Project, PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (also known as PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (also known as Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project, Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project, Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (also known as 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (also known as 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).   Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs.

Sinohydro is the contractor responsible for the implementation all of these projects. Environmental advocacy groups have opposed the MPSA agreement on the basis that it would involve the construction of roads and bridges in exchange for bauxite ore mined in part of West Africa’s Upper Guinean Rainforest. They argue that mining bauxite would destroy the ecosystem of the 233 square km Atewa forest in southeastern Ghana. Atewa is part of the Upper Guinean Rainforest, which is a critical ecosystem, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature.

89468,"Sinohydro provides $95.7 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Kumasi Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 2) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154) On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘Sinohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account. Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).    Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 2 Project) was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89468, Sinohydro provided $95,788,094.82 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($73,421,486.50) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of the Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 2 Project) covers 10 administrative areas in the Kumasi metropolis: a 11 km Manhyia Sub-Metro road, a 9.45 km Same Sub-Metro road, a 9.79 km Tafo Pankrono Sub-Metro Road, a 9.91 km Asokwa Sub-Metro road, a 6.29 km Kwadaso Sub-Metro road, a 7.43 km Oforikrom Sub-Metro road, an 8.98 km Subin Sub-Metro road, a 7 km Nhyiaeso Sub-Metro road, a 10 km Bantama Sub-Metro road, and a 20.15 km Asante Mampong road. The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months, involves improving pavement conditions; developing a network of local roads to ensure connectivity; resolving vehicular conflict at critical junctions in the project area; and improving road and drainage works in the project area. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 2021, project implementation had not yet commenced. As of September 2022, the project had achieved a 10% completion rate. 1.

89471,"Sinohydro provides $83.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway (Phase 1, Lot 5) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154) On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘SInohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project). Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway (Phase 1, Lot 5) Project was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89471, Sinohydro provided $83,857,382.35 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($65,405,561) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of the Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway (Phase 1, Lot 5) Project covers the construction of the 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway. The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months, involves earthworks and the provision of crushed rock base and an aesthetic finish; dualization of the heavily urbanized section between Adenta-Dodowa-Oyibi; and signalization of critical intersections. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 2021, project implementation had not yet commenced. 1.

The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).    Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region (Phase 1, Lot 8) Project was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89474, Sinohydro provided $53,537,267.16 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($40,844,015.08) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.   The scope of the Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (Phase 1, Lot 8 Project) covers the upgrading of selected Feeder Roads in the Ashanti and Western Region (measuring 68 km in length): a 4 km road from Achiase Junction to Wansamere (also known as the Achiasejxn-Wansamere-Awisasujxn Feeder Road), a 4.5 km feeder road from Mpasatia to Adupri (also known as Mpasatia - Town Roads), a feeder road from Nyinahin to Adupri (also known as Nyinahin-Adupri Feeder Road), a 29.7 km feeder road from Nyinahin to Achiase Junction via Sereso Timpon (also known as Nyinahin-Sereso Timpon-Achiasejxn Feeder Road), a 1.5 km feeder toad from Nyinahin Market Junction to Pentecost Church (also known as Nyinahin Market Junction to Pentecost Church Feeder Road), a 14 km feeder road from Nyinahini to Kyekyewere (also known as Nyinahini-Kyekyewere Feeder Road), and a 3 km feeder road from Keesekrom to Adiembra (also known as Keesekrom-Adiembra Feeder Road). The roads in the Ashanti Region are mainly to areas with bauxite. The scope of works includes: earthworks, surface dressing, road line markings and signs, as well as construction of related roadside drains, storm drains and critical culverts. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal sod turning ceremony took place on November 22, 2019. However, project implementation did not commence until December 28, 2019. The project was originally expected to reach completion in 30 months (June 28, 2022). As of September 2021, the project had achieved a 75% completion rate. The project was officially completed and commissioned on March 27, 2022. 1.

This PBC carries the following terms: 20-year maturity, 7-year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. The borrower is also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in a lender-controlled escrow account (beginning at $20 million and increasing to $90 million). The proceeds of the PBC are to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $1.383 billion commercial (EPC) contract between China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC) and the Government of Guinea, which was signed on January 22, 2016. The PBC agreement also specifies that the remaining 15% of the cost of the project must be funded by the borrower. The Government of Guinea met this counterpart funding requirement by selling its 51% equity stake in Société De Gestion de Kaléta (SOGEKA) — the project company responsible for the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (see Project ID#53003) — to China Three Gorges Corporation for $200 million.  Then, on September 4, 2018, the Government of Guinea and China Eximbank signed the PBC agreement. The Government of Guinea, in turn, used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Société de Gestion et d'Exploitation du Barrage de Souapiti, SA (SOGES S.A. or 苏阿皮蒂电站管理公司). SOGES S.A., which was established as a project company in August 2017, is jointly owned by the Government of Guinea (51% equity stake) and China International Water & Electric Corporation (49% equity stake). SOGES S.A signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned power utility, Electricité de Guinée (EDG), and once the Souapiti dam is operational, it will use the proceeds from the sale of electricity (generated by the dam) to EDG (for 20 years) in order to facilitate the repayment of the China Eximbank loan. Under the terms of the PPA, the Government of Guinea guaranteed the payment obligations of EDG to SOGES S.A. The Government of Guinea also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank loan (PBC).   The loan’s first tranche of $575 million was disbursed at the end of 2020. The loan’s second tranche of $300 million was originally expected to disburse in 2021 and the loan’s third tranche of $300 million was originally expected to disburse in 2022. However, neither of these disbursements took place. The second tranche was rescheduled for disbursement in 2023 and the third tranche was rescheduled for disbursement in 2024.  As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, Guinea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance identified the outstanding repayment obligations of SOGES S.A. under the China Eximbank PBC agreement as $575.11 million.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 450MW hydroelectric power plant (hydropower station) — with four power generation units — in the middle reaches of the Konkoure River (approximately 6 km downstream of China Eximbank-financed 240MW Kaleta hydropower station). Upon completion, the plant was expected to achieve an average annual output of 2.016 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) and serve both domestic customers and several neighboring countries in West Africa (including Senegal, Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau through the West African power grid). The Souapiti hydropower station consists of a roller compacted concrete (RCC) gravity dam and a ground powerhouse equipped with four vertical-axis Francis turbine generators of 112.5 MW rated capacity each. Each turbine is designed to operate at a rated head of 87 meters. The RCC gravity dam is 120 meter-high and has a crest elevation of approximately 215.5 meters, while the dam axis length is approximately 1,164 meters. The normal storage capacity of the dam is approximately 6.3 billion cubic meters (bcm) and the design water storage level is 210 meters. The other mechanical component in the project includes 21 flat steel gates, 12 trash racks, two arc gates, six hydraulic hoists, two fixed hoists, one sewage gate crane, and a tailgate crane station. A double trolley 160/50 tonnes (t) bridge crane was utilized for the lifting and installation operations during the project construction. The electricity generated by the Souapiti hydropower station is fed into the grid through an 8.7 km, 225kV double-circuit power transmission line connecting the Kaleta (Kaileta) substation.   China International Water & Electric Corporation, a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), was the general (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation.  However, many subcontractors were also involved. Harbin Electric Machinery Company manufactured and supplied the turbines and other hydroelectric units for the project. Sinohydro Bureau 3rd was subcontracted by CTCG for the civil engineering, grouting, electromechanical, and metal structures works in 2016, while Sailors Automation Technology Company was subcontracted for the supply of automation components in September 2018. Tractebel Engie was engaged to provide supervisory services for the project. It also assisted in the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) as well as the resettlement action plan (RAP). Yellow River Engineering Consulting was subtracted by CWE for the design and engineering services of the project. Yingtai Group delivered nine 10kV voltage grade 1,600KW diesel generator sets for the project. Nodalis updated the feasibility study and evaluated the technical and economic viability of the hydropower project.   On December 24, 2015, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. However, main civil construction works did not commence until April 2016. The first and second power generation units achieved grid connection on November 8, 2020 and November 30, 2020, respectively. The third power generation unit achieved grid connection on January 5, 2021. The fourth power generation unit achieved grid connection on March 25, 2021. The power plant reached its commercial operation date (COD) on June 24, 2021. A final project completion certificate was issued in July 2022.   However, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published in April 2020, the Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project has been plagued by a variety of social, environmental, and governance problems:  ‘[t]he dam’s reservoir will ultimately displace an estimated 16,000 people from 101 villages and hamlets. The Guinean government had moved 51 villages by the end of 2019 and said it planned to conduct the remaining resettlements within a year. Forced off their ancestral homes and farmlands, and with much of their land already, or soon to be flooded, displaced communities are struggling to feed their families, restore their livelihoods, and live with dignity. […] Residents displaced by the dam are resettled in concrete houses on land ceded by other villages. Residents have so far not obtained legal titles to their new land, creating a risk of future land conflicts between displaced families and host communities. Displacement is rupturing longstanding social and cultural links between families in the area. “In our culture, our social and familial bonds are essential,” said one displaced resident. “Extended families are being split apart. Whenever there is something to celebrate or mourn in the family, we feel the distance.”   Souapiti’s reservoir is also flooding a vast area of agricultural land, threatening communities’ means of subsistence. The dam’s reservoir will eventually flood 253 square kilometers of land, including an estimated 42 square kilometers of crops and more than 550,000 crop-bearing trees. A 2017 project document warned starkly that, “displaced populations will generally have less favorable land than they have been farming for generations.” Dozens of displaced residents told Human Rights Watch that they are already struggling to find adequate food for their families. “The people here are hungry, sometimes I don’t eat so my children can,” said a woman displaced from the village of Tahiré Center in 2019. Residents from several villages said that, whereas before being displaced they used to grow their own food, they must now find enough money to buy it from local markets. “With the fields gone, we’re slowly selling our cattle to make ends meet,” said a local herder and farmer. “We’re fragile like eggs because of the suffering here,” said a community leader relocated in 2019. “It’s only thanks to God that we survive.” Officials [from SOGES S.A.] acknowledged that displacement threatens communities’ livelihoods. “When you move a village, you’re breaking up the way they make a living, and you have to try to reestablish it,” said the [SOGES S.A.] head of environmental management and sustainable development. [SOGES S.A.] said it intends to restore communities to the same or improved standard of living that they enjoyed prior to the resettlement. SOGES S.A.] does not provide displaced residents with replacement farmland but said it will assist them to farm more intensively on their remaining land and find new income sources, such as fishing or cattle-raising. Displaced residents, however, have so far received no such assistance. “We’re not asking for something extraordinary. Prepare land for us to continue our activities, a pasture area for livestock farming. Respect the promises made,” said the president of Tahiré District, which encompasses several villages relocated in June 2019. International human rights standards require that resettled populations have immediate access to livelihood sources, and that resettlement sites should include access to employment options. The 2015 and 2017 action plans prepared to guide the resettlement recommended that [SOGES S.A.] begin work on livelihood restoration programs as soon as construction on the dam started in 2015.   At the end of 2019, however, [SOGES S.A.] had not started implementing livelihood restoration measures and displaced populations were receiving no support to help them reestablish the farming-dependent lifestyle they had left behind. [SOGES S.A.]told Human Rights Watch that it is, “in the process of redoubling its efforts to invest in the restoration of livelihoods in the coming month and for years to come.” [SOGES S.A.] pointed out that, in the short term, the government has provided food assistance – two deliveries of rice over six months and cash for basic essentials – to displaced families. “It helps people get on their feet,” said a [SOGES S.A.] official. But residents said that, given how long it would take to find new livelihoods, this was not enough. “We consumed what we were given in just over a month,” said a father of five who resettled in June 2019 from Warakhalandi. International standards recommend that displaced communities receive support until they return to the living standards they enjoyed prior to resettlement. [SOGES S.A.] also said that it compensates residents for the trees and crops growing on flooded land, although it has provided no payments to reflect the value of the land itself. Farmers have therefore received no compensation for land lying fallow as part of a crop rotation system, nor for land used for grazing animals.   A lack of transparency in the compensation process – with [SOGES S.A.] failing to adequately inform people about how compensation is calculated – has also fueled dissatisfaction with the payments made. Some residents said they have not been paid any compensation at all; others contend that, while they had been compensated for perennial crops, like fruit trees, they have received nothing for annual crops like rice or cassava. “The government gave us what they wanted. We accepted money without negotiation because we didn’t know the value of our resources,” said one village leader. Several women said that the bulk of compensation has been paid to men in family or community leadership roles, giving women little say over how money is used. Residents from all the villages Human Rights Watch visited said that they had complained to representatives of [SOGES S.A.] or to local government officials about the resettlement process, but that they had received either no response or one that did not address their concerns. “Someone says give [your complaint] to this person. They ask you to wait. He also has his director. Who are we supposed complain to?” said a community leader from Konkouré district. [SOGES S.A.] told Human Rights Watch that it had “delayed” in implementing a formal grievance policy, and only did so in September 2019, after more than fifty villages had been moved. [SOGES S.A.] did not explain the reason for the delay. As of December 2019, 110 complaints had been submitted to the new grievance mechanism. [SOGES S.A.] said that for future relocations is it negotiating agreements with communities that set out the Agency’s responsibilities during the process. While this could help clarify displaced residents’ rights, a sample agreement shared by [SOGES S.A.] contains only a single paragraph summary of the Agency’s obligations and offers no detail on how [SOGES S.A.] will address key issues like lack of agricultural land and support for livelihood assistance. [SOGES S.A.] should also ensure that residents have access to independent legal advice, of their choice, prior to signing agreements. 1. The Chinese project title is 苏阿皮蒂水电站 or 苏阿皮蒂水电站项目 or 苏阿皮蒂水电站.

52260,"ICBC and other Chinese banks pledge $657.5 million loan for Conakry Port Extension Project  On October 25, 2018, ICBC (Industrial and Commercial Bank of China) and 4 other Chinese banks agreed in principle to provide a $657.5 million loan to the Republic of Guinea for the Conakry Port Extension Project. This loan will reportedly be issued as a subsidiary loan agreement under the $20 billion Resource and Loan Cooperation Framework Agreement that the Chinese Government and the Republic of Guinea signed on September 5, 2017 (see Project ID#65113 and Project ID#64352). As such, it will carry the following terms: 15-year maturity, 4 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month Euribor plus a 2.5% margin. The proceeds of the loan will be used to fund 85% of the cost of a $774 million (nearly €650 million) EPC contract with China Harbour Engineering Co (CHEC).   The purpose of the Conakry Port Extension Project is to construct two multifunctional docks and a mineral dock, with dockyards adjacent to the 41.6-hectare wharf. The construction of a 4 km long road and an 11-hectare parking area capable of accommodating 600 trucks is also planned, as is the backfilling of a 35.7-hectare quayside platform. A social and environmental impact assessment has been completed for this project, and the commercial contract with CHEC was signed in October 2016. However, it does not appear that a loan agreement has been finalized. STAFF_NOTE:The Chinese project title is 几内亚科纳克里集装箱码头改扩建项目 or 科纳克里集装箱码头改扩建项目 or 了几内亚科纳克里自治港东区扩建项目.",False,0.3290041

58031,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.19 billion government concessional loan for Western Bypass Project On September 4, 2018, during the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance of Kenya signed an RMB 1,190,253,600 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Western Bypass Road Project.   The borrower is responsible for repaying the loan between September 25, 2025 and March 21, 2038, which implies a loan maturity length of 19.5 years and a grace period of 7 years. The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to the Government of Kenya’s External Public Debt Register, the loan disbursed RMB 172,583,320.45 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (in Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 504,859,536.18 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (in Fiscal Year 2021-2022). No principal repayments were made between September 4, 2018 and June 30, 2022. The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 174,180,942.31 as of June 30, 2020, RMB  346,764,262.76 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 851,623,798.94 as of June 30, 2022.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 16.358 km bypass road (dual carriageway) from Gitaru to Ruaka. The road begins at Gitaru on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway and connects with the Southern Bypass in Kikuyu town. It ends at Ruaka where it will connect to the Northern Bypass. The road was deigned as a Class A National Trunk Highway with 4 lanes and median strip. The Design Speed is 80km/h and the width of subgrade is 21m wide. The length of the main alignment of this project is 16.358km, with 17.351 km service roads (excluding ramps). The starting point of the alignment is connected to the end of the Southern Bypass of Nairobi City, intersected with A104, with a full cloverleaf interchange located at the intersection. The road mainly follows along the old alignment towards the northeast. The end of the alignment is located at Ruaka town, connecting the starting point of the Northern Bypass, and a single-trumpet interchange is set at Km14+813, connected with Limuru Road. Passing several large towns such as Wangige, Ndenderu and Ruaka etc., the road provides convenience for several large population centres along the line, with interchanges set at Km0+855, Km4+851, Km7+865, Km10+000, Km12+600, Km14+813, respectively. Pedestrian barriers will be installed in the midst to ensure that no pedestrian crossings occur at the non-authorized areas. The project also involves the construction of major interchanges at Dirt (Kwa Magu), Wangige, Ndenderu, Kihara, Rumingi and Ruaka.   CRBC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation and Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) is responsible for supervising its work.  Construction began on March 15, 2019 and the project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2021. As of November 2021, the project had achieved an 80% completion rate. The implementation of the project has reportedly created about 2,000 direct jobs for locals. Traders dealing with cement, steel and other crucial raw materials have also reportedly benefited from the construction of the road. 1.

Then, in July 2017, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was completed and a NEMA license [No.NEMA/EIA/PSL/5292] was issued. On September 4, 2018, China Eximbank and China GeoEngineering Corporation International Ltd (CGCINT) signed a $171,021,786.35 buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Bosto Dam Water Supply Project. The loan has a maturity  of 15 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2033). The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The borrower purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. The Government of Kenya also appears to have issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower (CGCINT) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of its $193,760,000 Engineering, Construction, Procurement, and Financing (EPCF) contract [NWC/RT/005/2016-2017] with the Government of of Kenya (National Water Harvesting and Storage Authority), which was signed on August 3, 2017. The Government of Kenya was responsible for providing counterpart financing to cover 15% of the cost of the EPCF contract.   The lender did not make any loan disbursements between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021 and Fiscal Year 2021-2022). Nor did the borrower make any principal repayments between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021 and Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was zero as of June 30, 2021 and zero as of June 30, 2022.   As of July 29, 2019, insurance premiums to Sinosure had been paid and a performance and advance payment guarantee was submitted by CGCINT. China Eximbank then notified the borrower that the loan had officially gone into effect on September 24, 2019. However, as of November 2021, the CGCINT had still not received payment from the Government of Kenya. A Member of Kenya’s Parliament noted in November 2021 that 'the delayed payment of 15% counterpart funding equivalent to [KES] 3.06 billion and the refusal by the Kenya Forest Service to approve access to the dam site No.1, which according to feasibility studies shows it is technically viable and has all necessary dam functionalities, has exposed the Government of Kenya to default and [it is] straining […] our country’s relations with the People’s Republic of China.’   The purpose of the project is to supply portable water to Bomet Town, Silibwet Town, Sotik Town, Siongiroi Town and Ndanai town and replace pump fed water service schemes that are not sustainable due to the high cost of electricity. The project site is located in Bomet County, 18 km from the edge of South Western Mau Forest as measured along the longitudinal profile of Kipsonoi River (35030.216E, 0032.259S). The project involves the construction of a 45 meter high zoned rockfill dam (with an impermeable clay core and an embankment crest length of 300 meters), a reservoir with storage capacity of 29.5 million cubic meters, a water treatment plant with a capacity of 80,300m3 per day, a 1 MW hydropower substation, a raw water main pipeline with a diameter of 900 mm extending 19 km, a 210 km transmission and distribution pipeline, and 30 storage tanks with 29,050m3 of total capacity. Upon completion, the project is expected to provide potable water to 705,857 people in the 4 constituencies of Konoin, Bomet Central, Sotik, and Chepalungu. The main urban areas to be covered by the project include Bomet Town, Silibwet Town, Sotik Town, Siongiroi Town and Ndanai town.   CGCINT is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Hunan Construction Engineering Group Corporation is involved in implementation. Media reports from 2020 and parliamentary records from 2021 suggest that project implementation has been delayed due to an array of political, financial and environmental issues, including the fact that the Kenya Forest Service has refused to grant the EPCF contractor access to the project site. 1.

Then, on June 1, 2018, China Eximbank and the Lesotho Ministry of Finance signed a RMB 700 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the 92 km Ha Mpiti to Sehlaba-Thebe Road Project. The GCL carried the following terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 1% service charge (or management fee), and a 0.5% commitment fee.   This project involves the construction of a 92 km, 7-meter-wide double-lane road segment between Ha Mpiti and Sehlabathebe (Sehlaba-Thebe). More specifically, it will connect the highlands of Qacha’s Nek, Thaba Tseka and Mokhotlong with the lowlands and continue onward to the Sehlabathebe National Park. Anhui Construction Engineering Group and Qingjian Group Co., Ltd (CNQC) are the contractors responsible for implementation.   A groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 6, 2018. However, this project has encountered major implementation delays and provoke local protests and controversy. Local residents are reportedly upset because of concerns about not being compensated (sufficiently) for their loss of land, houses, pastures and livelihoods. During the project’s construction period, it was expected that xx Basotho would be employed. However, local residents have raised concerns about CNQC’s alleged failure to recruit local labor for unskilled work. Local businesses that hoped to serve as subcontractors and suppliers to CNQC have also registered concern.   One businessman, Mpota Moiloa, said he had gone out of his way to protect CNQC when it was sued by a local for quarrying sand on his site without a license. He told a local newspaper that “I have been operating a hardware shop since 2000. I have also been mining sand since 1991.” “I am currently entangled in a lawsuit with a fellow local after Qingjing asked me to step in and assume responsibility on their behalf on the grounds that they would be [penalized] more as a foreign concern. They said they would repay me with [favors] when it came to the awarding of tenders. But when I asked to supply them with cement, they told me to join the queue of those who had applied to be tenderers. They said if they considered my tender, they would want me to sell them a bag of cement for only M95. Mind you we buy a bag of cement for M97 in Matatiele (across the border in South Africa). I refused and they said they would not do business with me. They now buy from local Chinese dealers and when they do not have any stock, they go to other Chinese dealers in Mohale’s Hoek. We had hoped we would benefit from the road construction in our area but we are suffering. My business is falling apart.”   One local chief, ‘Malireko Sehahle, said CNQC had not fulfilled any of the promises it made to the villagers when it began work on the project: “When the construction work started, we sat down with [CNQC] to discuss how the community would benefit or be compensated for the loss of fields. Among other things, the community wanted water tanks in exchange for quarrying by the Chinese contractor. I noticed that the contractor never objected to any of the community’s demands and promised to [fulfill] them. But to date, they have not done anything to the benefit of the villagers. I think the problem is that we never asked them to sign any document where they committed to anything. It was just a verbal agreement.”   Then, in May 2021, Basotho employees of CNQC went on strike, claiming that their concerns and complaints had gone unanswered. Robert Mokhahlane, Secretary-General of the Construction Mining, Quarrying and Allied Workers Union (CMQ), told a local news outlet that the CNQC workers — who are also members of CMQ — went on strike following two unanswered petitions from the workers union. Among other complaints, Robert Mokhahlane said workers were being underpaid, and expelled from work whenever their employer wished to do so without any disciplinary hearing as dictated by the labor code order of 1992. He also said that “workers are […] punished for stolen equipment without any proof and investigations on who really stole it. They have their salaries cut without having any word with them, while those Chinese are also stealing from the company themselves.” He also told a local news outlet that that workers’ salaries have a pay-as-you-earn deduction, but the tax collection was not being remitted to Lesotho Revenue Authority by CNQC. He said that “what made us realize this is the fact that workers are never given payslips to know more about their salary details.” He further noted that complaints during the first week after the Easter break when workers demanded to be paid their owed salaries that were never paid from a Covid-19 induced lockdown In January 2021. The workers also went on strike over unsafe transportation as they travel to and from the Mpiti-Sehlabathebe road project work site. Robert Mokhahlane said that “workers are […] delivered to work in trucks, with some equipment inside and this is unsafe.” He also noted that “a woman was injured early February [2021] after falling from the truck that was also loaded with roads signs, a generator, and some other site equipment and is still at home nursing her injuries.” According to Robert Mokhahlane, under the terms of an agreement between CNQC and the Government of Lesotho, CNQC is responsible for providing food and accommodation for all its employees at a campsite. However, he said that CNQC had failed to honor this commitment since the project began in 2018. 1.

55627,"China Eximbank provides $73.7 million preferential buyer’s credit for Safe City Project In 2015, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. submitted an unsolicited bid to the Government of Mauritius to implement a Safe City Project (SCP). Then, on April 1, 2018, China Eximbank and Mauritius Telecom Ltd — a minority state-owned telecommunications company in Mauritius — signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement worth $73,687,000 for the Safe City Project. The PBC carries a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 7-year grace period.   The Government of Mauritius issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance the cost of commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed in December 2017. The loan’s outstanding amount was $22,349,375 on June 30, 2018, $58,963,735 on December 31, 2019, $62,730,781 on December 31, 2020, and $65,050,841 on June 30, 2021.   The Safe City Project involved the installation a CCTV Smart Camera Surveillance System, a Multimedia Radio Trunking System, a Central Watch and Management System, an Integrated Emergency Response Management System, and an Intelligent Command System to enable the Police Department to obtain better intelligence with a view to optimizing responses. The original project scope also included the provision and installation of 4,000 ‘smart cameras’ (intelligent surveillance cameras) in major public areas — specifically, along main roads and motorways, pedestrian walkways and traffic centers — 500 trunking smart handsets, 500 trunking vehicle radios, 4,500 smartphones, and 150 fixed desktop terminals to provide an ‘umbrella’ for public safety in Mauritius. The project’s stated objective was to enhance the security and safety of the public. Police stations in Cote d’Or, St Pierre, La Gaulette, Poudre d’Or, St Pierre and Petit Gabriel in Rodrigues were expected beneficiaries of the equipment and technology.   Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. On August 19, 2019, the Government of Mauritius officially launched the SCP’s centralize command and control center. However, 18 months after the project’s scheduled completion date (June 2019), the SCP was still not fully operational.  As of December 30, 2020, only 130 of the 300 Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) cameras had been installed in 69 of the 75 sites; 346 vehicular mounted radios had been installed in police vehicles, while 4 had not yet been installed; and one static radio terminal had not yet been installed in a police station.   As of January 28, 2021, only one of the seven sub-command centers had been completed and commissioned, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the hosting of servers had not been finalized, and ‘smart’ cameras were only installed at 756 of the 2,000 Intelligent Video Surveillance (IVS) sites. Delays in the implementation of the SCP were attributed to: a decision to install steel poles for the IVS cameras instead of CEB poles as originally planned during implementation phase; installation issues related to the servers at the Government Online Centre; an issue related to the ‘End of Supply’ of the communication equipment; and the serial numbers of cameras not matching those specified in the technical specifications. The project also become a source of local scrutiny and controversy due to concerns about transparency and data privacy/security.   The purpose of the SCP was to provide tools and technologies to the Police Service to help it monitor and manage its resources so as to enhance its responsiveness and efficiency through real time information. However, the Mauritius Police Service later told the country’s National Audit Office (NAO) that it could not share key pieces of information about the project because of the nature of two contracts that its signed with Mauritius Telecom (MT) — a partially state-owned enterprise — in December 2017 to implement the SCP through an operating lease model. The Mauritius Police Service informed the NAO that it could not furnish either of these contracts due to the inclusion of mutual non-disclosure clauses in the contracts. Section 110 (2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Mauritius specifies that ‘the public accounts of Mauritius and of all courts of law and all authorities and officers of the Government shall be audited and reported on by the Director of Audit and for that purpose the Director of Audit or any person authorised by him in that behalf shall have access to all books, records, reports and other documents relating to those accounts’. According to the NAO, ‘[the] clauses in [the] contracts [between MT and the Mauritius Police Service] deprives the Director of Audit of access to public records for audit purposes’ and ‘the constitutionality of [the clauses] is questionable.’ The Police Service informed NAO that the advice of the Attorney-General’s Office was being sought on the matter.   Apart this these government accountability issue, concerns haven arisen about who stores and controls the data collected through the SCP. The Government of Mauritius has maintained that the Mauritius Police Force will operate the cameras and have custody of data collected. However, during a court case, officers from the Mauritius Police Force testified that the data was in fact held by MT. MT was quick to release a public statement saying that the data was stored at the Government Online Centre – a public body under the aegis of the ICT ministry. 1.

On December 19, 2017, the Police Service signed two contracts on an operating lease model with Mauritius Telecom (MT) for the implementation of the SCP: (a) Lease of Intelligent Video Surveillance (IVS) and Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) cameras, and Centralised Command and Control Centre for a total cost of $410 million (VAT Exclusive) for a 20-year period. On October 29, 2018, an addendum to the contract was signed for the provision of steel poles for fixing of cameras for some $9.3 million (VAT Exclusive). The variation was due to non-availability of appropriate poles. (b) Lease of Radio Communications System for some US$ 46 million (VAT Exclusive) for a 20-year period. Under the first contract, the Government of Mauritius was required to make a non-refundable advance payment of $13 million (VAT Exclusive), annual fees of $16.6 million (VAT Exclusive) during the first seven years and $21.6 million (VAT Exclusive) for the remaining 13 years. Additional annual amounts of $714,000 (VAT Exclusive) are payable during the first 12 years and $95,000 (VAT Exclusive) during the remaining period for the provision of steel poles. An annual amount of some $2.3 million (VAT Exclusive) is also payable under the second contract on a quarterly basis. The total contract amount was thus $465.3 million, exclusive of VAT.

This loan has a 5 year maturity. CNG (Nigeria) Investment Ltd also provided equity investment and a non-shareholder loan for this project. On December 21, 2017, and May 10, 2018, the World Bank Group’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) agreed to issue guarantees of up to $30,452,058 to China Development Bank (CDB) of China and of up to $41,360,000 to CNG (Nigeria) Investment Ltd. (CGIL) of Hong Kong, respectively, for their non-shareholder loans, shareholder loans and equity investments into CNG Glass (Nigeria) FZE in Nigeria. The guarantees were issued for up to five years for the shareholder and non-shareholder loans, and for up to ten years for the equity investment against the risks of Expropriation, Transfer Restriction, and War and Civil Disturbance. Beijing Qinchang Glass Co., Ltd.（北京秦昌玻璃有限 公司), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the CGHL, also agreed to provide mortgage over its legally owned industrial property and apartment, to the CDB for the liabilities of the borrower [CNG Glass (Nigeria) FZE] under the loan agreement.  The Float Glass Plant Construction Project involves the design, construction and operation of a float glass manufacturing plant with a capacity of 500 tons per day (tpd) in Nigeria’s Ogun Guangdong Free Trade Zone, about 30-km from Lagos. The project will require an area of approximately 250,000 m2, and will include construction of a raw material storage warehouse and batching; float glass combined workshop; finished products warehouse; cooling water circulation system; protective gas preparation system; furnace and chimney; and offices and worker accommodation. The production process consists of charging the raw materials required to make clear or colored glass through weighing, mixing and conveying to the furnace which produces molten glass. The molten glass then passes into a bath of molten tin where the temperature is gradually reduced and the glass sheets can be pulled off the bath by rollers. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. This is followed by annealing, cutting and loading.  The project will also include construction of a natural gas power generating system (installed capacity 6 MW) and a back-up diesel generating system (installed capacity 6 MW). Natural gas will be supplied by the local natural gas company via a pipeline, which has already been constructed to supply the Ogun Guangdong Free Trade Zone (see Project ID#52477). Diesel will be brought to site via truck.  The project is located within the OGFTZ located in the Igbessa Region of Ogun State. The zone opened in 2009 as a partnership between the Ogun Statement Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government in China. A total of 10,000 ha has been allocated for the zone, but thus far, only 250 ha has been developed (i.e. land prepared and fully fenced). As of March 2016, 27 companies were operating within the zone and an additional 14 have committed investments. Raw materials for the glass production, including silica sand, dolomite, feldspar, limestone, glauber salt and coal powder, will be sourced domestically. Soda ash will import from overseas. Raw materials will be transported via powder truck by a licensed contractor. Both raw materials and the final product will be transported by existing roads.  China Glass Holdings Limited (CGHL) is constructing the float glass and on-line solar control glass production line with a capacity of 500tpd.

60921,"ICBC contributes $80 million to syndicated loan for Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project On June 12, 2018, Indorama Eleme Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited -- a special purpose vehicle that is legally incorporated in Nigeria and a subsidiary of Indorama Corporation (Singapore) -- signed a $1 billion syndicated loan agreement for Phase II of the Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project.  The deal was put together in challenging conditions for the Nigerian market, but it was well structured and had the backing of revenues from the first fertilizer line financed in 2013 (which was also awarded The African Petrochemical Deal of 2013 by PFI). ICBC appears to have been a late add to the syndicate, as when it was originally announced, the loan was lead managed by IFC, which directly lent $100 million (as well as under its managed co-lending portfolio program) together with equally large participations by joint mandated lead arrangers and lenders -- European Investment Bank, Yes Bank, CDC Group, African Development Bank, Bank of Baroda and Standard Bank. In addition, Standard Chartered, Bangkok Bank, FMO, DEG, Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund, Proparco, ICICI Bank and Citibank also participated in the deal. ICBC reportedly contributed $80 million to the syndicated loan for the Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project.   No MIGA cover or partial risk guarantee were required. The tenor on the debt was 11 years door-to-door for DFIs and 8 years for commercial banks with a four-year principal grace period.  The Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Plant which began operation in May 2016 is located on Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited (IPL) site in Port Harcourt, River State and produces 1.4 million MTPA of urea fertilizer. The Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project consists of the expansion of IFL’s existing fertilizer complex in Port Harcourt, Nigeria from 1.4 to 2.8 million TPA by adding a new and identical train to the existing fertilizer plant. The new fertilizer plant (Line II) will consist of (i) Ammonia unit with a single train of 2,300 metric tons per day (MTPD); (ii) Urea unit with a single train of 4,000 MTPD granular urea; (iii) Urea granulation unit with a single train of 4,000 MTPD design capacity; (iv) Additional small urea granulation unit of 800 MTPD design capacity and (v) Inside boundary infrastructure, utilities and storage facilities.   Construction of the second fertilizer line began in April 2018. The second line of ammonia-urea plant and its associated facilities was successfully completed and commissioned in April 2021.   The project was categorized as 'category one' project by Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Environment (FMEnv), which confirmed the need to conduct a full blown ESIA. An ESIA for the project was subsequently carried out in line with national legislation. The ESIA process conformed to the AfDB’s ESAP. An ESMP was also adopted.   In April 2018 a complaint was filed with the  Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by 134 IEFCL employees raising a series of concerns regarding the company’s labor and working conditions and use of security forces. Specifically, these concerns pertain to: (a) salaries/welfare; (b) discrimination; (c) unionization; (d) tax calculation and union dues withholdings; (e) discipline and treatment of employees who complained to CAO and/or who criticize management; (f) workplace safety, hazards, and hazard allowance; (g) healthcare coverage; and, (h) impacts associated with a July 2017 protest. CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in May 2018. The CAO team conducted an assessment trip in September 2018. During CAO’s assessment, there was a lack of consensus amongst the parties to engage in a CAO facilitated dispute resolution process. In accordance with CAO’s Operational Guidelines, the complaint has been referred to CAO’s compliance function. In December 2019, CAO completed a compliance appraisal of the case. While the range of issues raised by the complainants are potentially serious, enhanced supervision by IFC subsequent to the July 2017 protest has considered the company’s approach to labor issues and security. Where gaps against Performance Standard requirements were identified, IFC documented implementation of corrective actions. However, while IFC supervision provides general assurance of the company’s PS2 performance, questions remain as to IFC’s response to allegations that the company has taken a retaliatory approach to workers who have raised grievances with the company. CAO concludes that this issue raises substantial concern regarding the application of PS2 to IFC’s investments and requires further investigation by CAO. CAO’s investigation will be limited in scope to IFC’s review and supervision of the company’s disciplinary procedures and approach to grievance handling, including its response to the specific grievances raised in the complaint.  In June 2021, CAO finalized the compliance investigation in relation to the case, making two non-compliance findings in relation to IFC’s supervision of the environmental and social (E&S) risks and impacts of the project.  The investigation report was sent to IFC for formal response.  CAO’s investigation concluded that, while IFC enhanced its supervision of the Company’s WGM since 2018 and documented improvements, IFC supervision activities do not provide sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of the Company’s WGM regarding PS2 requirements. Particularly, IFC lacks assurance that the Company is implementing a WGM which provides workers with a channel to address their concerns in a manner that is perceived as safe and fair. The investigation also concluded that IFC’s response to the complainant's allegations of Company retaliation against workers was insufficient and represents a non-compliance with the Performance Standard 2 requirement to ensure the right of workers to organize and raise grievances without fear of reprisal. An appropriate IFC response would have included actions aimed at further understanding and assessing the situation, such as: engaging with workers alleging instances of reprisals to review their claims and concerns, and/or a more in-depth review of whether the company’s WGM was effective and whether disciplinary procedures had been properly applied. CAO concluded that the lack of guidance at the IFC and client level on handling allegations of retaliation at the time was an underlying cause of this non-compliance finding. Finally, CAO also concluded that available evidence, in this case, is insufficient to make findings of adverse outcomes in relation to the complainants’ allegations of retaliation. CAO’s investigation report and IFC’s response, which included a Management Action Plan (MAP), were cleared for publication by the IFC Board of Directors on September 16, 2021. The first Management Progress Report on the Implementation of the Management Action Plan was published on October 26, 2022. 1.

The GCL is captured via February 8, 2018. The RMB 200 million grant is captured via Project ID#92565. According to the Government of Senegal’s Aid Management Platform, the GCL disbursed in 2019 and 2020 and achieved an overall disbursement rate of 100%.   This project aims to leverage information and communication technology to reduce the digital deficit and make Senegal a sub-regional hub in West Africa, particularly in the areas of security, education, health, and tourism. The Smart Senegal Project consists of five major sub-projects: (1) Safe City: This sub-project aims to strengthen public security through the use of technological tools and processes for the collection, analysis of flows, events from various communication systems and dissemination of information; (2) Smart Education: This sub-project project aims on the one hand to modernize network, processing, and data storage infrastructures and on the other hand to deploy technological platforms to improve teaching and learning in universities, schools elementary, middle and high schools in Senegal. (3) Smart Territories: This sub-project aims to provide user-centered services (citizens, administrations, and businesses) by building a citizen’s house (“La Maison du Citoyen”) in all the country's departments; (4) Submarine Cable: The purpose of this sub-project is to land a submarine cable in Senegal allowing access to international bandwidth. This new device will increase Senegal's internet capacity and vary the Internet access offer for ISPs; and (5) Smart Wifi: The Smart Wifi sub-project project aims to fight against the digital isolation of territories by increasing the number of digital access points. It will allow citizens to access a high-speed internet connection in public places. This access will be open to all citizens and will be available on all types of terminals (smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc.). In essence, this project aims to support the digital transformation of Senegal's networks.   Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation began in January 2019, and in early 2021, Huawei installed an online-meeting platform for the central government of Senegal, allowing high-level officials to meet virtually amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The digital hub portion of the project was completed on June 22, 2021 and celebrated during a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by the Senegalese President Macky Sall and Chinese Ambassador to Senegal. At this ceremony, the Government of Senegal also announced its plans to transfer government data to the center. 1. The French project title is Projet Smart Senegal.

On June 22, 2021, Senegal announced it would move its government data and digital platforms to a new national data center financed by a loan of $83.3 million USD from the Export-Import Bank of China and built by Huawei, which also provided equipment and technical support. The first phase of the new center, located in the Digital Technology Park in Diamniadio, will be open in six months and will also house data from state-owned enterprises in Senegal. The announcement comes on the heels of another agreement signed between Huawei and the African Telecommunications Union (a specialized agency of the African Union), which stipulates that the Chinese company will engage at multiple levels of ICT integration and transformation with AU member states. This will likely involve skills development and training for personnel in local ICT sectors, and information exchange on the latest technological trends and expansion of rural connectivity across Africa.3.

58379,"China Development Bank provides $2.5 billion loan for 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#52560) On July 24, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) and Eskom — South Africa's state-owned energy utility company — signed a $2.5 billion loan (term facility) agreement for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 3.7149% interest rate. The borrower is expected to make 20, equal semiannual installments (on March 12 and September 12 of each year) over a 10 year period (after the expiration of the grace period). The South African Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. However, the interest rate and other key terms and conditions in the loan agreement remain unavailable, as President Ramaphosa indicated that this information will not be made public due to confidentiality clauses. The successful conclusion of the $2.5 billion CDB loan agreement brought Eskom in line with the company’s commitment to secure 62% of its financial year 2018/19 funding requirement. By the end of 2021, the loan’s estimated disbursement rate was 83.62%.   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kusile coal-fired power station (plant), which contains six units with about 800MW capacity each, totaling about 4800MW in the La Faral area of Limpopo, South Africa. The project also includes a power station precinct, power station buildings, administrative buildings, roads, and a high-voltage yard. The total cost of the project is $19.1 billion.   Construction of the Kusile Station commenced on June 5, 2007. However, by April 2011, the project had only achieved a 21% completion rate. In 2015, it was reported that Unit 1 would come online in 2016 and the last unit would come online by 2021. However, the project was still being implemented as of 2022. The expected completion year of the Kusile Power Station is now 2026 (after being pushed back from its originally scheduled completion date of 2023).   Project delays have resulted from the financial management problems of Eskom and the termination of a turbines contract with Alstom. According to IJGlobal, in the 11 years since the project was announced, it has attracted no fewer than 22 banks, export credit agencies, and investment funds all of which offered different services, such as Bank of America (advisory service); Deutsche Bank (loan); JP Morgan (funding plan adviser); Barclays (advisory service); Credit Suisse Group (transaction adviser); Societe Generale (loan); and China Development Bank (loan). The loan from the China Development Bank came at an opportune time as many banks and insurers in Europe, the US, and Japan have in the past few years announced changes to their energy investment policies to exclude financing for new coal-fired power projects.  There are some indications that the $2.5 billion CDB loan for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In February 2019, the CEO of Eskom was asked the following question by a reporter: 'Can you indicate and comment in general terms on the World Bank, DBSA, China Development Bank and other DFI loan covenants, and what may be considered a breach, such as failure to meet required going concern status, debt service coverage ratio and/or other metrics?' He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics — interest cover, debt service cover, and so on. When we do find ourselves in a situation where we will not meet these requirements, many of the terms do allow us to put forward an action plan on how it’s going to be resolved.' Then, in February 2023, South Africa’s National Treasury announced that it would would take on ZAR 254 billion ($14 billion) of Eskom's ZAR 423 billion debt that was at risk of default, to enable the state-owned power utility to pay down its principal and interest obligations. 1. The Chinese project title is 库赛利燃煤电站项目. 2. Project ID#52560 records another $500 million loan from CDB for several power plants including Kusile in 2016. 3. This project was part of the Special Loan for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in Africa initiative under the framework of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum.4. The annual financial statements of Eskom demonstrate that the China Development Bank disbursed $3,763,000,000 to Eskom between 2017 and 2022 (under the $1.5 billion loan agreement captured via Project ID#58385, the $2.5 billion loan agreement captured via Project ID#58379, and the $500 million loan agreement captured via Project ID#52560): a $500 million disbursement in 2017, a $650 million disbursement in 2018, a $900 million disbursement in 2019, a $938 disbursement in 2020, a $455 million disbursement in 2021, and $320 million disbursement in 2022.

58012,"China Eximbank provides $248.8 million loan for Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project On January 25, 2018, the Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan and the South Sudanese Finance Minister signed a preferential loan framework agreement. On the same day, the Government of South Sudan and China Eximbank signed a $248.8 million loan agreement for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract between South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority and China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) Limited, which was signed on October 14, 2016. This loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) airport fees/revenues that the borrower is required to deposit in a lender-controlled escrow account.  The loan's amount outstanding was $231,952,567 as of December 2022.  The purpose of the project is to construct Juba ATMS center, a new Air Traffic control tower and operation building, a surveillance system, a navigation system, and a communication system. The Juba ATMS center is located next to Juba International Airport. The project also involves the civil engineering and supporting facilities required by the equipment (such as meteorological facilities), calibration flight test training, and other forms of training for South Sudanese technicians (to prepare them for management of the air space by 2023).   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced in June 2020 and it was originally expected to reach completion by June 2023. On July 6, 2021, South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority (SSCAA) announced the launch of a state-of-the-art online system, which allows the opening of new routes. The newly established lower airspace, launched in partnership with aviation solutions provider NavPass, is designed to boost tourism and generate revenue for the economy, according to SSCAA. Through the system, operators of commercial, cargo, and aid aircraft can integrate Juba International Airport into their routes. ""Through this partnership with NavPass, South Sudan will see higher volumes of aviation trade, greater business opportunities, and improved route efficiency, safety, and reliability,"" explained Capt. David Subek Dada, SSCAA's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He added, ""This marks a crucial step towards a more prosperous future for the whole of South Sudan through additional direct and indirect economic activity.” Speaking during the launch of the air traffic management system, Tom Perkins, the CEO of NavPass said the establishment of internationally compliant and globally accessible airspace was a critical and symbolic move for the country in building economic potential, connectivity, and business. ""For every dollar invested in sovereign airspace, capacity translates into between five and 20 dollars of economic impact. We're proud to be working with governments across the world, including South Sudan, to optimize and monetize airspace, bridging the divide between nations,"" he noted. Built on the global-standard Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) system, South Sudan's airspace reportedly uses an AI-powered platform to record all flights in real-time. The system automatically collects more than 99% of eligible fees, compared with the 70-80% collected by some of the world's largest economies. NavPass chief executive, Thomas Perkins, said that apart from capturing the movement of all aircraft in the country’s skies in real-time, the technology will also automate the fee collection process with proceeds invested back into the country’s air infrastructure, in line with the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) principles. The revenues that are collected will reportedly be transferred into an escrow account.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2023, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of South Sudan to be at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on June 14, 2023, South Sudan’s National Transport Minister Madut Biar on Wednesday revealed that CHEC had halted work its work on the ATMS Project due to delays in the payment of an outstanding bill worth $36 million. He said that the Government of South Sudan had a contractual obligation to pay CHEC $6.2 million every January 21 and July 21, but this did not happen because of a failure to pay by South Sudan's Ministry of Finance.  Two weeks later, on June 27, 2023, the Chinese Government called upon the Government of South Sudan to expedite the payment of arrears for the construction of the country’s ATMS. Speaking to Radio Tamazuj during an interview, Mu Jianjun, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in South Sudan, said that China Eximbank had halted the project and was waiting for the Government of South Sudan to pay the arrears for the works done before completing the construction of the country's ATMS. Mu Jianjun said “[w]e are waiting for payment from the Government of South Sudan and we suggested that the government pays as soon as possible because this project is very important for South Sudan."" 1.

26602,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.045 billion government concessional loan for Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project On December 6, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Zimbabwe signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on April 8, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed an RMB 1,045,139,500 ($153 million loan) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. The Government of Zimbabwe on-lent the proceeds of the loan to the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ). The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity period, a 7 grace period, an interest rate of 2% per year, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The borrower is expected to deposit the proceeds from the Air Infrastructure Development Fund and passenger services charges at Harare International Airport into an escrow account with Stanbic (to facilitate the repayment of the loan and as a source of de facto collateral). The escrow account is jointly monitored by the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank.   As of August 2020, the loan had achieved a 85.7% disbursement rate ($131.2 million out of $153 million). Additional disbursements worth $27.8 million took place in 2022, bringing the loan disbursement rate to at least 100%. The loan’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $81,231,518.01 as of 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new international terminal building at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport with a construction area of ​​35,000 square meters, a new VIP building, and a satellite command center. It also involves maintenance on the existing 1.6 km runway, parking lot, and control tower, and the transformation of the existing terminal building and fire center. The project will also seek to increase the airport’s handling capacity from 2.5 million people per year to six million people per year. China Jiangsu International is the contractor responsible for project implementation.    On July 23, 2018, an official project commencement ceremony was held. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (July 23, 2021). However, this project has been plagued by scandal, controversy, and delay. In 2019, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe diverted $10 million from the project’s escrow account. China Eximbank then halted disbursements for the project and said that it would not release additional funds until the $10 million withdrawal was returned. It appears that this condition was eventually met because project implementation continued in 2020 and 2021. On February 26, 2020, Chinese Ambassador Guo Shaochun visited Zimbabwe to inspect the airport reconstruction. As of July 2020, the project achieved a 27% completion rate. China Eximbank also made a $27.7 million loan disbursement in 2020. Then, on September 1, 2021, President Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe visited the project site.    In mid-2022, the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance released a report, which provided evidence that the China Eximbank loan for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project has financially underperformed. It noted that ‘[t]he low disbursements of loans is due to accumulation of arrears to active China Eximbank loans […] on projects such as the Victoria Falls International Airport ($54 million), NetOne network expansion ($61 million) and expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport ($3 million).’ It also noted that, by the end of 2021, total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project.     As of August 2022, the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project had achieved a 67% completion rate and the Government of Zimbabwe had taken delivery 3 (out of 5) radars to support an air traffic control system. At that time, major outstanding works included refurbishment of the existing building and the procurement of required equipment. 1.

As of June 2016, a project feasibility study was underway. Upon its completion, a loan application was to be prepared and submitted to China Eximbank. In 2017, CSCEC announced that the $3.225 billion project would be financed by China Eximbank.  In order to manage the implementation of the project and repay the loan that would finance the construction of the port, Serport (the Algerian public group acting as a port authority) and the two Chinese construction companies (CSCEC and CHEC) created a joint venture (special purpose vehicle). Serport holds a 51% ownership stake and the two Chinese construction companies (CSCEC and CHEC) hold a 49% ownership stake in the joint venture. On January 17, 2020, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, China Harbour Engineering Company and Algeria’s state-run Port Services Group formed a joint venture to implement the project.  Then, on June 29, 2020, the President of Algeria instructed the country’s Prime Minister to ‘make new contact with the Chinese partner and study the project on new transparent bases in order to submit it for the second time to the Council of Ministers, within a maximum period of three months.’ In November 2020, Algeria’s Finance Minister announced that the El Hamdania Deepwater Container Port Infrastructure Project would commence in early 2021. Then, on March 14, 2021, Mr. Amar Grine, was appointed as Director General of the National Agency for Construction of Cherchell Port (Agence Nationale de Réalisation Port Centre de CHERCHELL or ANRPCC). Seven days later, on March 22, 2021, it was reported that construction would begin in May 2021 and take four years to complete (May 2025). Then, in December 2021, Amar Grine announced that the project was being rescoped and he expected the cost to be downwardly revised.  The purpose of the project is to construct a deepwater container port in the village of El Hamdania within Cherchell district (the so-called Central new Port of Algeria). Upon completion, the port is expected to have 23 docks capable of processing 6.5 million 2-foot containers and 26 million tons of goods per year. It is also expected to be managed and operated by China’s Shanghai International Port Group for 25 years under a concession agreement. 1.

Then, on April 5, 2017, China Eximbank formally issued a $675.5 million ‘mixed credit’ to the Government of the Republic of Cameroon for Phase 2. It provided an RMB 1 billion government concessional loan (GCL) (captured via Project ID#53116) and a $524,579,992 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan (captured via Project ID#53396).

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 22 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 11 year grace period. Both loans were secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the revenues of the Autonomous Port of Kribi, which were to be deposited by the borrower into an escrow account (known as the ‘Control Account’).  The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development (MINEPAT).   As of December 31, 2020, the GCL had achieved a 21.1% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 64.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 17.3 billion.

Then, in February 2015, Cameroonian President Paul Biya issued a presidential decree authorizing the Minister of Economy, Planning and Territorial Rehabilitation to sign a $90.1 million financing (supplier credit) agreement with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. for the PowerCube5000 Micro-Grid Solution Project. The borrowing terms of the supplier credit are unknown. It is also unclear if the supplier credit agreement was ever finalized.  However, it is known that Bank of China and the Government of Cameroon signed a $90.1 million buyer’s credit loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project on February 1, 2015, and Bank of China and the Government of Cameroon signed a $123,250,000 loan agreement for Phase 2 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project on September 1, 2017. The Bank of China loan for Phase 1 carried a 13 year maturity, 4 year grace period, and 4.2% interest rate.

Project ID#57697 captures the buyer’s credit loan from Bank of China for Phase 1 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project. Project ID#53234 captures the loan from Bank of China for Phase 2 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project.   The purpose of the Solar Rural Electrification Project was to supply, install and operate photovoltaic infrastructure (known as solar mini-grids or solar micro-grids) in 350 localities (villages and towns) in Cameroon. The project, which was implemented in two phases, sought to cover 58 states within 10 major regions across the country and deliver 70MW of solar energy to 150,000 people across 1,000 sites and 350 localities. Phase 1 targeted 166 localities and Phase 2 targeted 184 localities. It was originally envisaged that villagers would pay less than FCFA 100 for a kilowatt of power once the project was fully operational.   Huawei was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both phases of the project. Phase 1 officially commenced on November 29, 2016. Huawei reportedly installed a number of solar-backed micro-grid systems across the country in 2017, with systems ranging from 30 kW to 300 kW in size, featuring advanced maximum power point tracker (MPPT) technology, high-efficiency inverters, and advanced charging-discharging management. Phase 1 ultimately delivered 11.2MW of solar energy to 166 localities (villages and towns) and it reportedly benefited between 13,984 and 22,240 households (including 3,100 households that secured electricity connections in 2021). These localities received electricity from a solar power plant in the village of Nsem, which was officially commissioned in November 24, 2018. However, the first phase of the project was plagued by accusations of corruption and embezzlement. As of late 2021, Phase 1 was not yet complete. However, the management of all photovoltaic infrastructure that was installed during Phase 1 was handed over to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency in February 2021.   Phase 2 commenced in 2018, and as of December 14, 2018, it had achieved a 31% completion rate. As of late 2021, all Phase 2 construction activities were complete and 9,820 household electricity connections had been established (including 3,946 in 2021), but the Phase 2 campaign to increase the number of households with electricity connections was still underway and efforts to transfer management of all photovoltaic infrastructure installed during Phase 2 to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency were ongoing. In November 2020, the Government of Cameroon announced plans to pursue a third phase of the project, which would seek to reach an additional 200 localities (villages and towns).  There are some indications that the Bank of China loans for the first and second phases of the Solar Rural Electrification Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

53396,"China Eximbank provides $524.5 million preferential buyer's credit for Phase 2 of Kribi Deep Sea Port Project (Linked to Project ID#53116 and #350) On January 19, 2016, China Eximbank expressed its willingness to finance Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. Then, on April 5, 2017, China Eximbank formally issued a $675.5 million ‘mixed credit’ to the Government of the Republic of Cameroon for Phase 2. It provided an RMB 1 billion government concessional loan (GCL) (captured via Project ID#53116) and a $524,579,992 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan (captured via Project ID#53396).   The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 7 year grace period. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 22 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 11 year grace period. Both loans were secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the revenues of the Autonomous Port of Kribi, which were to be deposited by the borrower into an escrow account (known as the ‘Control Account’).  The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development (MINEPAT).   As of December 31, 2020, the GCL had achieved a 21.1% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 64.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 17.3 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the PBC had achieved a 25.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 200.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 31.4 billion.   Phase 2 involved the construction of a 1,102m long quay, the expansion of the container terminal from 700m to 1,050m, and the addition of both an ore and oil terminal. China Harbour Engineering Company Limited was the contractor responsible for implementation. Phase 2 was completed on March 2, 2018.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’ 1.

57586,"China Eximbank provides $141.8 million buyer’s credit loan for Phase 2 of 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#289) On February 28, 2017, China Eximbank signed an a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement with Cameroon's Ministry of Power and Water Resources worth $141,839,830 for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 320 basis points. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to partially finance the cost of a commercial contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 90.9% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 6.9 billion) and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 69.1 billion.   The purpose of the project is to evacuate 211MW of electricity from the Memve'ele dam (on River Ntem) to Yaounde. The project scope includes (1) the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa; (2) the installation of a 225kV, 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabissan (Memve'ele), Ebolowa and Ahala substations; (3) deviation of the existing 225kV Mangombé-Oyomabang single-circuit electricity transmission line and the existing 90kV Edéa-Yaoundé single-circuit electricity transmission line; (4) the construction of two new Ebolowa and Nkol Nkumu 225kV substations; and (5) extension of the existing Ahala substation from 90kV to 225kV. Upon completion, these transmission lines to Ebolowa and substations are expected to connect the dam to Cameroon’s southern network and to Yaoundé. Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project construction began in 2011 and the dam was completed since June 2017, but energy evacuation works are being built and it is expected to be announced in August 2020.  As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaoundé evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate (and at least 280 of the 294 pylons were installed). However, the completion of the project (commissioning of the dam) depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line’s corridor.  The people located along a 5 km route of this 270 km line are claiming nearly FCFA 3 billion (EUR 5 million) in compensation, and as of December 2021, this issue had not been resolved (after several failed attempts and deadlines). In late June 2021, during a special plenary session of the National Assembly, Cameroon’s Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Essomba provided an update on the status of the project. He explained that “Memve’ele hydroelectric plant is already injecting 90MW of energy into the South Interconnected Network” and “once the 225kV line is completed […] the volume of production injected will rise to 211 MW.” However, according to Sinohydro 16th Bureau, the hydroelectric power plant will not operate at full capacity after the completion of the 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabizan and Ebolowa because of the flow of the Ntem River.  The company’s experts believe claim that the flow of the Ntem River will not be sufficient to regularly drive the power plant’s four (52.75 MW) turbines.   The solution suggested by Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the construction of a reservoir and the project is reportedly being ‘fine-tuned’ to address this issue. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the Memve’ele hydroelectric power plant and Nyabizan-Yaoundé transmission line since ‘powering up’ from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations, which has led to a substantial reduction in the fuel costs that were previously borne by the Government of Cameroon. Phase 1 of the project was also financed by China Eximbank in 2012 and completed in 2016 (as captured via Project ID#289).

Green for Growth Fund (Germany) contributed $20 million.     ICBC (China) contributed $60 million. It contributed $20 million to three different project companies responsible for three separate, 50 MW solar power plants: SunRise Energy, Rising Sun Energy, and Al Subh Solar Power.  The participants in the loan syndicate accepted a streamlined, standardized, one-size-fits all, financing package with limited negotiation room in exchange for speed, certainty of execution and greatly reduced transaction costs by sharing data, pooling a single set of lender’s advisors, agents and account banks. The maturity length of the loan was 18 years. The interest rate that applied to ICBC’s debt contribution is unknown. However, it is known that IFC arranged a mix of A, B and C loans – the latter of which is similar to mezzanine, being subordinate to the senior debt and carrying a higher margin. It is also known that ICBC contributed to the B loan. The financing package, approved under Egypt's solar feed-in tariff program, was supported by a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC).   The purpose of the project was to develop, construct and commission three Nubian Suns solar photovoltaic (PV) plants — with aggregate power generation capacity of 150 MW  (186 MWp peak capacity) — in Beban Solar Park (محطة بنبان للطاقة الشمسية) within Aswan Governorate.  Upon completion, the project was expected to provide clean, cost-effective power to over 350,000 residential customers and generate up to 6,000 jobs during construction. TBEA Solar Co. Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts and the operations and maintenance (O&M) of the 3 power plants.  On February 26, 2019, the complex was completed after 11 months of construction.  This project is also known as the Nubian Suns Renewable Energy Financing Program and the Nubian Suns FIT Financing Programme.

Both the ICBC and ERBD contributed USD $70,000,000 as lead arrangers of the loan. The loan has a maturity length of 18 years. Its interest rate and grace period are unknown. On December 15, 2017, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) signed a contract in which it agreed to issue guarantees of $42,046,560 to ICBC for its investment into Alcom Energy JSC. The guarantees are issued for up to 20 years against the risks of Transfer and Convertibility Restrictions, Breach of Contract, Expropriation and War and Civil Disturbance.   The purpose of the syndicated loan from ICBC and EBRD is to develop, construct, and commission three solar power plants in Beban Solar Park (محطة بنبان للطاقة الشمسية) within Aswan Governorate.  The 3 power plants will have a combined capacity of 165.5 MW (67.5 MW, 70 MW and 28 MW, respectively) at the 1.8 GW Benban Solar Park (or Complex). The project is expected to produce power for 80,000 homes as well as reduce Co2 emissions by 156,000 tons annually. All of the solar projects are being developed under Egypt’s Feed-in Tariff (FiT) scheme. ACWA Power was granted a 25-year  Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and it will sell the power generated by the three solar plants to the state-owned Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) (the off-taker). The project is allocated to plot 3-1 (approximately 97 hectares (Ha)) in the Benban complex. The project will have alternating current capacity of 50 MWAC and peak direct current capacity of 70MWDCP, and will be linked to substation 1 (SS1) on the northeastern corner of the Benban complex via an underground 22 kilovolt (kV) transmission line following the internal routes right-of-way (RoW) installed by EETC. SS1 covers an area of 15 km2. The Benban solar complex comprises a 37-square kilometer (km2) area allocated to Egypt's New and Renewable Energy Agency (NREA) located in the western desert, 15 km west of the River Nile and approximately 1 km west of Aswan – Luxor highway. The complex is approximately 650 kilometers (km) from Cairo.   With the exception of the narrow and densely populated Nile Valley with its intensive agriculture, the area is all desert land, largely unused and unpopulated. The area is mainly flat, with sand and gravel dunes, and with no notable natural vegetation and no human activities. The nearest villages are Benban village, about 12 km east and Fares village about 25 km northeast of the Benban solar complex, with 26,200 and 11,000 inhabitants respectively. The nearest cities are Aswan, 40 km south and Luxor 140 km north. The Benban solar complex was sub-divided into 39 plots each allowing for a solar plant of up to 50 megawatts (MW) with a total capacity for the entire site of up to 1.8 Gigawatts (GW).   As per Government of Egypt (GoE) requirements, each plot in the Benban solar complex is allocated to a separate project company, requiring separate permits to operate; although one company may have ownership stakes in more than one project. Power evacuation will be the responsibility of EETC. Power will be evacuated from the new substations via an existing 220 kV high voltage line, 12 km east of the Benban solar complex.  The total cost of this project is $185 million. $140 million is being provided via debt financing and $5 million is being provided via equity contributions.   A consortium of Astroenergy and CGGC (China Gezhouba Group Corporation) International is the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor and First National Operation & Maintenance Co. Ltd (NOMAC) — a fully owned subsidiary of ACWA Power — is the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) contractor. On January 7, 2018, this project reached financial closure.

Then, on October 2, 2017, the Government of the Gambia’s Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Amadou Sanneh submitted an application to China Eximbank for a $177,077,885 government concessional loan (GCL) to support Banjul Port Extension Project. The proposed borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period. The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance 100% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   The Banjul Port Extension Project, if implemented, would install a new jetty, an approach bridge, channel dredging, maintenance of the dredging rehabilitation container terminal, a head office for use of the port authority, and repairs to the Banjul wharf. However, this project has been plagued by domestic controversy and it does not appear that a loan agreement with China Eximbank has been finalized. The Gambian Ministry of Justice questioned the legality of the Government of the Gambia’s contract with CRBC because it was issued without following standard competitive bidding procedures.

At this meeting, the Gambian Works Minister reportedly decided not address four issues related to the EPC contract that were by flagged by external consultants (GAMWORKS and NIRAS Consulting Engineers of Denmark) but rejected by CBRC: concerns about the $177 million face value of the China Eximbank loan, the establishment of unit prices/rates after the completion of detailed project design work, the absence of a value-for-money analysis, and GPA requirements. The Gambia’s Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Lamin Camara, also raised concerns with the Works Minister, Secretary General and the GPA Board Chairman, noting in email correspondence that ‘I MUST say once again that the country is not in position to absorb such a loan facility as it will eventually take us to a very serious level of debt unsustainability and would eventually make us miss our programs with the [IMF] and the [World Bank] and that may ultimately affect the gains we achieved in the Barrow government.’ He also warned that the ‘[China Eximbank] loan facility comprises of one fifth of the whole public debt of the country so there is no way it can be financed given the current situation’. 1.

56878,"China Eximbank provides $25.9 million concessional loan for Gambia National Broadband Network (GNBN) Project (Linked to Project ID#56893) On December 22, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of the Gambia signed a $25,900,473 loan agreement for the Gambia National Broadband Network (GNBN) Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity. It is apparently secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a minimum cash balance in an escrow account that is accessible to the lender.   Gambia Telecommunications Company (Gamtel) — a state-owned telecommunications company — is responsible for repaying the loan (through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of the Gambia). However, there are indications that it has underperformed vis-a-vis the expectations of the lender. In June 2018, the IMF noted that the Government of the Gambia had breached its target on contracting new non-concessional external debt due to the $25 million China Eximbank loan for the Gambia National Broadband Network (GNBN) Project.  Then, in 2019, a World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) revealed that the Gambia was in debt distress. Approximately two years later, according to a January 2021 IMF report, Gamtel 'did not make sufficient provisions for servicing the loans contracted from the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) for the construction of The Gambian portion of the ECOWAS Wide Area Network (ECOWAN) and from [China Eximbank] for the construction of the Gambian National Broadband Network (GNBN). [...] [T]he arrears [to China Eximbank] were incurred on the interest payment falling due on March 21, 2020 (i.e., within the period leading to the approval of G20 DSSI, giving rise to an expectation that the initiative would cover it under the clause referring to the outstanding arrears). In the end, the [Gambian] authorities cleared these arrears (US$0.25 million) on June 19, 2020.  Going forward, GAMTEL is expected to maintain and replenish a dedicated escrow account to ensure timely servicing of its debt obligations.'  The main objectives of the GNBN Project were to bring faster fiber access direct to subscribers while making per-MB internet access cheaper. It involved the installation of at least 420 km of fibre-optic cable, augmenting 947 km of fiber optic cable already deployed through the West Africa Regional Communication Infrastructure Programme (WARCIP). It also involved the installation of a data center.  The implementation of the GNBN Project was originally expected to increase the Gamtel's annual income by as much as $13 million.   Huawei Technologies and Gamtel were responsible for project implementation. On April 22, 2019, Ambassador Ma Jianchun inspected the Gambia National Broadband Network Project and conducted a special survey on China-Gambia and China-Africa cooperation in the field of information and communication. Luo Wenjun, Economic and Commercial Counselor of the Embassy, and Zhao Quan, head of Huawei's Gambia office, accompanied him. Ambassador Ma inspected the Gambia National Broadband Network Project related facilities such as data centers, optical fiber access points, and optical fiber distribution points. He also listened to reports on the development of Gambia’s business and implementation of the Gambia National Broadband Network Project. On June 26, 2019, the GNBN Project was officially completed and put into operation. The commencement ceremony was presided over by Gambia’s Vice President Dr. Isatou Touray, and attended by the Chinese Ambassador to the Gambia and the West African regional director of Huawei. The Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Momodo Sane and Cabinet Ministers of the Government of The Gambia were also in attendance. During the ceremony, the Chinese Ambassador to the Gambia, Ma Jianchun, gave a speech. He emphasized the important progress for information and communication technology, one of the eight priority areas of the ‘Gambia National Development Plan (2018-2021),’ that this project allowed. The Gambia National Broadband Network is the first large-scale information and communication technology cooperation project between the two countries, and it is also the only Gambia infrastructure project financed by concessional loans from China to date. 1.

58510,"China Eximbank provides RMB 575.5 million government concessional loan for 132KV Kenya Power Transmission Expansion Project (KPTEP) (Linked to Project ID#58359) On April 4, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed an RMB 575,507,992.10 government concessional loan for 132KV Kenya Power Transmission Expansion Project (KPTEP). The proceeds of the loan were on-lent to a Kenyan state-owned electricity company called the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO). The loan carries a maturity of 18.25 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2035). The ultimate borrower (KETRACO) used the loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract with China Aerospace Construction Group Corporation Limited.   Loan disbursements worth RMB 42,233,873.01 took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021). Loan disbursements worth RMB 90,938,925.44 took place between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 42,233,873.01 as of June 30, 2021 and RMB 133,172,798.45 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the project is to construct 210 kilometers of electricity transmission lines, including (1) the construction of a 50 km, double-circuit 132kV Awendo-Isebania transmission line — that runs through Migori — and a new substation in Isebania, (2) the construction of a 120 km, single-circuit 132kV Sultan Hamud-Loitoktok overhead transmission line (OHL) — that runs from Makueni County to Kajiado County in Mashuuru and Oloitokitok Sub Counties — and two associated substations; and (3) the construction of a 40 km, double-circuit 220kV Isinya-Konza transmission line that connects Konza substation to the Isinya substation, thereby ensuring reliable power supply for Konza Technopolis (or the Konza Techno City), which is an innovation hub constituting of technology firms and it is situated on a 5,000-acre piece of land 60 km from the country’s capital city of Nairobi.   China Aerospace Construction Group Corporation Limited is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The construction of the Isinya-Konza transmission line commenced on or around November 14, 2019. This project component was originally scheduled for completion by December 2022. The construction of the 120 km, single-circuit 132kV Sultan Hamud-Loitoktok overhead transmission line began in March 2022. As of 2021, the overall project had achieved a 55% completion rate. 1. This project is also as Phase 2 of the Kenya Power Distribution System Modernization & Strengthening Project, the Kenya Power Transmission Expansion Project, 210Km 132KV Kenya Power Transmission Expansion Project (KPTEP), the Sultan-Hamud-Loitoktok 120km, 132kV Transmission Line and Associated Sub-stations Project, the 50 km, 132 KV Awendo-Isebania Transmission Line Project, the 40 km, 220 KV Isinya-Konza Transmission Line Project, and the KENYA POWER TRANSMISSION EXPANSION PROJECT: 132KV AWENDO - ISEBANIA, 132KV SULTAN HAMUD - LOITOKTOK & 220KV ISINYA - KONZA Project. 2. Some sources, including SAIS-CARI and Boston University, suggest that a separate, stand-alone China Eximbank loan (or buyer’s credit) in 2019 was issued for the 40 km, 220 KV Isinya-Konza Transmission Line Project. However, AidData has not yet identified any official evidence from the Government of Kenya’s public debt register or e-ProMIS that a 2019 loan agreement was ever signed. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. The Kenya Electronic Project Management Information System (e-ProMIS) project identification number is Ket0012019. The KETRACO project identification number is MOE&P/KPTEP-01-2015. The loan identification number in the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register is 2017014_1. 4. e-ProMIS identifies the loan commitment date as April 4, 2017 rather than May 15, 2017. This issue warrants further investigation.5. Some sources suggest that the loan was issued in the form of a buyer’s credit (with credit insurance from Sinosure) to finance 85% of the commercial contract between KETRACO and China Aerospace Construction Group Corporation Limited. This issue warrants further investigation. 6. Some sources suggest that the face value of the loan was RMB 677,068,226 ($112,000,000) and it was issued on May 15, 2017. This issue warrants further investigation.7. The amounts outstanding, disbursements, and repayments data are drawn from the Kenyan Treasury’s External Public Debt Register.

58707,"China Eximbank provides $90.2 million buyer’s credit loan for Kamburu-Embu-Kibirigwi-Thika Transmission Line Project On August 1, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a $90,286,383.39 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Kamburu-Embu-Kibirigwi-Thika Transmission Line Project. The loan carries a maturity of 17 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2034). The other borrowing terms of the BCL are unknown.   However, it is known that the proceeds of the BCL were on-lent to a Kenyan state-owned electricity company called the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO). The ultimate borrower, KETRACO, used the proceeds of the BCL to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $118 million commercial contract between a consortium consisting of China North Industrial Corporation (NORINCO, 中国北方工业有限公司) and Shandong Taikai Power Engineering Co. (TKPE, 山东泰开电力建设工程有限公司) and Kenya's Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, which was signed on January 29, 2016 and amended on May 26, 2017, October 18, 2019, and April 30, 2020.   No BCL (loan) disbursements or principal repayments took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021 and 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was zero as of June 30, 2021 and zero as of June 30, 2022.  The purpose of the project is to construct (1) a 153 km, 220kV transmission line from Kamburu to Kibirigwi (via Thika and Embu) with bay extension at the Kamburu substation, (2) a 3 km 132 kV transmission line and three 150MVA 220/132kV substations at Embu, Kibirigwi and Thika, and (3) a 132kV LILO substation at Kibirigwi on the Masinga/Kutus transmission line.   NORINCO and TKPE are the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was carried out for the project in June 2009. Then, a November 2018 Sector Report from the Government of Kenya's Treasury Department identified the project as having cumulative expenditures of KES 2.651 billion as of June 30, 2018; it also identified the project as having achieved a 1% completion rate, with a status designation of ‘need[s] budget provision.’ However, by 2021, the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Its originally scheduled completion date is December 2022. 1.This project is also known as the Kamburu-Embu-Kibirigwi-Thika & Uplands Transmission Line Project, the Kamburu Embu Thika Project, the 148 km Kamburu-Embu-Thika Transmission Line and Associated Substations Project, the Kamburu- Embu - Kibirigwi - Thika - 220KV Transmission Line and Associated 220-132KV Substation Works and 132/66KV Substations Project, and the 220kV Kamburu-Embu-Kibirigwi-Thika Project. The Chinese project title is Kamburu-Thika 132/220kV电力线路传输及变电站工程建设项目. 2. Some sources suggest KETRACO was the original borrower and others claim it is the Government of Kenya.  The Kenya Electronic Project Management Information System (e-ProMIS) identifies July 14, 2016 rather than August 1, 2017 as the loan commitment date. These issues warrants further investigation.  3. According to page 56 of the KETRACO 2019-2020 Annual Report, an RMB-denominated loan related to the construction of the Kamburu-Meru transmission line (Thika, Embu, and Kibirigwi are between Kamburu and Meru) was transferred from Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) to Kenya Electricity Transmission Company (KETRACO), on October 19, 2016. According to the novation agreement, KETRACO is required to make bi-annual payments to the Government of Kenya (GoK). However, as at 30 June, 2020, KETRACO had not made any payments to GoK, as stipulated in the novation agreement. Management has indicated that a moratorium for twenty-four (24) months had been sought from The National Treasury. However, this request for moratorium was yet to be considered by the National Treasury. It is unclear which loan this is referring to. 4.

58737,"China Eximbank provides $200.5 million loan — via EPCF arrangement — for Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project On April 24, 2017, Kenya's Ministry of Water and Sanitation -- through Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) -- signed an Engineering, Construction, Procurement, and Financing (EPCF) contract worth $235,918,461 with M/S Avic International Holding Corporation and Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (Group) Co., LTD Joint Venture (AVIC & SMEDI JV) for the Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project. AVIC & SMEDI JV, in turn, secured a $200,530,600 loan on February 14, 2017 from China Eximbank to finance 85% of the cost of the $235,918,461 EPCF contract. The loan’s final maturity date is July 21, 2042 and it is repayable in 20 equal, semi-annual installments. Therefore, its implied maturity length and grace period are 25.5 years and 15.5 years, respectively. The Government of Kenya appears to have issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan.   Loan disbursements worth $13,364,912.29 took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021). Loan disbursements worth $133,093,268.26 took place between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).  The loan’s amount outstanding was $11,795,831.20 as of June 30, 2020, $25,160,743.49 as of June 30, 2021, and $158,254,011.75 as of June 30, 2022.   The Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project involves the construction of a 59-meter-high dam with a capacity of 26.5 million cubic meters of water, a water treatment plant (with 70,000 m3 per day of capacity), and a water distribution system (involving 67 km of raw and treated water pipelines and two terminal tanks in Ruiru and Juja). It will be constructed across Kariminu River at Kiriko in Gatundu North Sub-County, Kiambu County in order to supply an additional 850,000 people with 70 million liters/day of water to Juja Town (11.75 million liters/day), Ruiru Town (35.25 million liters/day) and Nairobi City (23 million liters/day). It is just upstream of the main bridge linking Buchana to Kariko and Gituamba Markets about 6km from Kanyoni market on the Thika – Gituamba road. The dam will be constructed across Kariminu River downstream of its confluence with its tributaries including Gathanje, Kagundu and Githanga. The project requires the acquisition of 600 acres of land: 171 acres during phase 1 for the dam’s embankment and water draw-off structures and 429 acres during phase 2 for the reservoir area.   AVIC & SMEDI JV is the EPC contract responsible for implementation.  The project was originally scheduled to commence in January 2018 and reach completion by December 2022. However, it has encountered various delays and implementation challenges. After mobilization of the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) study team, a commencement meeting with Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) took place on March 16, 2016, followed by a combined reconnaissance site visit on April 6, 2016. Then, in mid-2017, an advance payment worth 20% of the EPCF contract ($47,183,692) was made to AVIC & SMEDI JV against a bank guarantee. On March 28, 2019, a Kenyan parliamentary committee conducted an on-site project inspection and found that no works had commenced 24 months after agreements were signed and an advance payment of KES 4 billion ($47,183,692) was made to the contractor (AAVIC & SMEDI JV). The committee also found that Athi Water Services Board had not yet issued a commencement to proceed letter to the EPCF contractor because of land acquisition challenges. The parliamentary committee also called upon Kenya's Auditor General to conduct a special audit to ""investigate the circumstance under which agreements were signed between the Athi Water Works Develoment Agency and the contractor (AVIC International) and advance payments were made before the acquisition of the requisite land for implementation of the Karimenu II Dam leading to loss of public funds through idle time."" It further recommended that ""[i]f any culpability is found, the perpetrators should be prosecuted."" A resettlement action plan (RAP) was implemented for priority areas, and a compensation process for 246 project affected persons was undertaken in order to acquire 171 acres of land (as part of phase 1). However, in early 2021, Gatundu North residents who had surrendered 383 acres of land for construction (phase 2) had still not received compensation and they vowed to block excavation works at the project site. One local resident said “[w]e gave the land to the government for the construction of the dam and we were promised to wait for compensation several months ago. We are, however, shocked that the land is being excavated even before we get our pay,.” Jane Wanjiru, another resident, said that the surrendered land was their only source of livelihood and they had not cultivated this season to allow for the construction of the dam: “[w]e can’t fight the government; we hope that this matter is resolved. These frustrations are making us hopeless and we need to have our lives back. We are calling on the National Land Commission (NLC), which has been executing the compensation exercise and the Athi Water Services that is implementing the project to intervene and solve the prevailing tussle to allow smooth construction works to go on.” Construction ultimately began on or near August 1, 2019. As of September 2019, the project had achieved a 5% completion rate. June 2021, a pipe laying works ceremony took place. At that point in time, the project had achieved a 45% completion rate and the other key project milestones that had not yet been met were groundbreaking, tunnel breakthrough, completion of tunnel secondary lining, river diversion, and substantial completion of dam foundation treatment works. The dam was ultimately completed and officially completed on August 1, 2022. 1. This project is also known as the Kariminu II Dam Project. The Chinese project title is Karimenu大坝供水项 or 肯尼亚卡瑞曼纽大坝供水项目. 2. Joseph Wairagu Irungu, the Principal Secretary of Kenya’s Ministry of Water and Sanitation, identified the face value of the China Eximbank loan as KES 23.6 billion on January 1, 2019. However, AidData relies upon the face value of the loan ($200,530,600) that is recorded in the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register (https://www.treasury.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/External-Public-Debt-Register-as-at-End-June-2020.pdf). 3. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that it released in July 2020, SAIS-CARI identifies the face value of the China Eximbank loan for the Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project as $31 million. Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center reports a face value of $229 million in its China’s Global Development Finance Dataset. AidData instead relies on the $200,530,600 that is recorded in the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register. 4. Karimenu II Dam was first identified through a feasibility study carried out in 2012 by the AWSB as a source of water for supply to Ruiru and Juja towns and parts of Nairobi. 5. Under most EPCF contractual arrangements, a loan is extended to the EPC contractor but with a sovereign guarantee from the host government. Therefore, AidData assumes that the loan issued to AVIC & SMEDI JV is backed by a repayment guarantee from the Government of Kenya (i.e. a sovereign guarantee). 6.

59392,"China Eximbank provides RMB 438 million government concessional loan for Nation Wide Remote Sensing Airborne Geophysical Survey Project On August 14, 2013, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Tourism & Wildlife Najib Balala signed an MOU with Eng Jia Xuetian, President of China's Geological Exploration Technology Institute (GETI) for a nationwide remote sensing, airborne geophysical survey. A commercial contract was then signed on May 19, 2014 for an aerial survey that was expected to result in the creation of a geological map of Kenya's mineral resources (in order to make it easier for investors to make investments in the mineral sector).   On August 31, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya's Ministry of Mining signed an RMB 438,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Nation Wide Remote Sensing Airborne Geophysical Survey Project. The loan carries a maturity of 17 years (final maturity date: September 21, 2034). Its other borrowing terms are unknown.   No loan disbursements or principal repayments took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021 or 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was zero as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2022.  The purpose of the project was to undertake multispectral remote sensing, aeromagnetic, and radiometric survey in combination with satellite imagery studies as well as upgrading of geological services in Kenya with a view to determining the mineral potential of the country. The mapping was to be carried out of the country’s entire area of 582,650 square kilometers using aeromagnetic and radiometric methods after which the geophysical testing will be carried out to verify the resources available. An aerial survey was supposed to compile a new geological map detailing the occurrence of minerals around the country that would help spur investment in the mining sector. Part of the components of the airborne survey include; five magnetic maps, five radiometric maps and five electromagnetic maps.    Geological Exploration Technology Institute  (GETI) of Jiansu Province was the contractor responsible for project implementation. However, in 2018, the Kenyan Government froze its contract with GETI after mining stakeholders protested that entrusting the survey to the Chinese could result in manipulated and compromised data. Kenya's National Intelligence Service was then brought onboard to manage, co-ordinate and supervise the project. This development followed reports from two consulting firms -- UK-based International Geoscience Services (IGS) and the Canadian firm Paterson, Grant & Watson Limited (PGW) -- that GETI was not suited for the job in addition to concerns about data privacy. GETI has reportedly billed the Government of Kenya for 2 billion Ksh, equivalent to 30% of the value of its contract.   Some reports suggest that China Eximbank cancelled its loan agreement with the Government of Kenya in late-2018. However, it appears that the loan agreement and the project were either not cancelled or cancelled and reinstated at a later date because (a) the August 31, 2017 China Eximbank loan agreement is included in the June 2021 version of the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register, and (b) official media sources in China and Kenya extensively covered the launch of the the final report of the nationwide airborne geophysical survey on June 21, 2022. 1. The transaction amount was initially recorded as $112 million in the Kenya Electronic Project Monitoring Information System (eProMIS); however, other sources report that the value of the loan agreement was 7 billion Ksh. MOFCOM reports that the face value of the loan was RMB 440 million. AidData relies on the face value of the loan that is recorded in the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register (RMB 438,000,000). 2. The loan identification number in the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register is 2017041_1. 3. The Chinese project title is 肯尼亚矿产勘测项目. 4.

59494,"China Eximbank provides $134.9 million buyer’s credit loan for Phase 2 of Technical And Vocational Training Laboratories (TIVET) Project (Linked to Project ID#46982) On February 14, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a $134,967,400 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for Phase 2 of the Technical And Vocational Training Laboratories (TIVET) Project. The BCL carried a 16 year maturity (final maturity date: January 21, 2033) and a 2% interest rate. It was scheduled for repayment over 10 years in 20 (equal) semiannual installments (implied grace period: 6 years). The loan is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract [agreement number AVIC/KEZ/13M5077] between the Government of Kenya’s Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (肯尼亚高教部) and Avic International Holding Corporation (中航国际), which was signed on September 5, 2013 and amended on May 25, 2016. The original cost of the commercial contract was $284,068,659. However, this figure was later revised to $166,618,659 via Addendum No 1 to the contract. The contract value was then further revised to $158,785,183 via Addendum No 2 dated May 25, 2016, after the Government of Kenya opted to undertake the civil works itself, thereby leaving the supply, installation, and commissioning of the equipment as well as human capacity building to Avic International Holding Corporation.  Loan disbursements worth $1,701,510.65 took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021). Loan disbursements worth $7,853,131.60 took place between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was $122,240,957.30 as of June 30, 2020, $123,942,467.95 as of June 30, 2021, and $131,795,599.55 as of June 30, 2022.  Under the project, Avic International Holding Corporation is responsible for equipping 134 institutions of technical, vocational education, and training across the country. 1,500 teachers are to be sent to the field and 150,000 students are to be trained by 2020. Under the terms of the Government of Kenya's contract with Avic International Holding Corporation, all equipment was to be delivered before the closure of the contract on March 20, 2020. 1.

57313,"China Eximbank provides $156 million loan for Phase 2 of Analog to Digital Migration Project (Linked to Project #57618, #72888) On February 27, 2017, the Government of Mozambique and China Eximbank signed a $156,000,000 loan agreement for Phase 2 of the Analog to Digital Migration Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a $133 million commercial contract between the Government of Mozambique and StarTimes Media (Mozambique) Co., Ltd, which was signed in 2014.  The purpose of the project was to facilitate Mozambique’s transition from analogue to digital broadcasting systems. The project involved construction of a nationwide digital transmission network, digital transformation of the national TV station, construction of digital TV terminals, and training of Mozambican technicians.   StarTimes Media (Mozambique) Co., Ltd — a project company and joint venture of StarTimes and Focus 21 Mozambique — was the contractor responsible for project implementation. On March 19, 2017, a project commencement ceremony took place.  The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2021. However, it was officially completed in October 2020. Then, in December 2020, Chinese state media reported that StarTimes had expanded the country’s satellite television transmission network to cover 2.5 million rural residents. A ceremony marking the digital transformation of the national TV station took place in June 2021.   Phase 2 was plagued by controversy because the commercial contract was granted to StarTimes Media (Mozambique) Co., Ltd through a (non-competitive) sole-source procurement process and Focus 21 Mozambique is associated with the family members of the President of Mozambique.  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Analog to Digital Migration Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283). 1.

The total cost of the Coral South Floating Liquefied Natural Gas Project is $8.8875 billion and it is reportedly being financed with $4.6575 billion of debt and $4.212 billion pf equity. It involves the construction of a Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) facility off the shores of Mozambique with integrated gas treatment, liquefaction, storage and offloading systems.  The Coral South Floating Liquefied Natural Gas Project was officially launched on June 2, 2017. Then, on July 20, 2019, Eni started installation works on the hull of the Coral Sul floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) treatment and liquefaction unit that will be moored offshore in Mozambique. The hull is expected to be launched in 2020, in line with the planned production startup of the Coral South Project in 2022.  Upon completion, the FLNG facility will have 6 subsea wells that connect to a floating facility capable of producing 3.4 million tons per annum (mtpa). This project seeks to monetize the gas discoveries contained in the southern part of the Area 4 Block. The Area 4 Block is located in the deep waters of the Rovuma Basin, which is located off the north-east coast of Mozambique. FLNG is a relatively new approach to exploiting offshore gas, and involves adapting existing LNG technology to an offshore, floating vessel. It makes the production, liquefaction and storage of natural gas possible at sea, unlocking gas resources from underwater gas fields previously considered uneconomic or too challenging to reach.

The Federal Government of Nigeria made a counterpart contribution to the project worth $314,529,784.90. The PBC (loan) carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, a 2.5% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The final maturity date of the loan is September 21, 2037. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the loan had achieved a 69.77% disbursement rate ($884.27 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $29.82 million and no principal repayments to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $884.27 million.   Phase 2 of this project involved the modernization of a 156.65 km railway section from Lagos City, Nigeria’s largest port city in the south, to the northeast via Abeokuta and Ibadan. This section is part of a larger 1,313 km standard gauge railway that runs from from Lagos to Kano and carries both passenger and cargo. Phase 2 also includes the construction of a 300 meter link between the Apapa Port Complex and the Lagos-Kano Railway.   China Earth Group Fuzhou Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for the design of the project. China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) is the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project and its work is being supervised by Italy’s Team Nigeria LTD. Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Transport is the project ‘owner’.   Construction began on May 5, 2017. The Government of Nigeria announced that it had achieved a 50% project completion rate as of January 15, 2019. The opening ceremony of the commercial operation of the Lagos-Ibadan Railway was held on June 10, 2021, and the Lagos-Ibadan section of the railway launched commercial operations. However, the second phase of this project encountered a number of problems and delays related to adverse weather, labor disputes, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The larger 1,313 km standard gauge railway modernization project — known as the Nigerian Railway Modernization Project and the Lagos-Kano Railway Modernization Project — that runs from Lagos to Kano remained unfinished as of May 2022. China Eximbank had previously agreed in principle to finance the other sections of the $8.3 billion project (captured via Project ID#1844, #60767, #60850, and #195). However, it later decided not to finance the other railway sections.   In February 2022, Nigeria’s Transport Minister Rotimi Amaech told reporters that ‘We were waiting on the Chinese to give us the loans we applied for and till today they’ve not replied. […] They kept delaying us.’  Consequently, the Government of Nigeria sought funding from other sources, including Standard Chartered Plc and Chinese state-owned commercial banks. None of these funding sources ever materialized, which put President Muhammadu Buhari in a difficult political situation. Before the country’s election in 2019, the ruling party (All Progressives Congress) had promised to complete the Lagos-Kano railway before the next nationwide vote in 2023. 1.

62222,"ICBC and China Eximbank provide $659 million syndicated loan for Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#62223, #62224) On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies — consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. — regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as ‘Queen Elizabeth II Port’). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.   On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured Umbrella Project ID #62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID #62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID #62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company (National Port Development (SL) Ltd. ), project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).   The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.   This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books. 1.

The Facility Agreement references the following Security Documents: (a) Share Pledge Agreement: Sky Rock Ltd., the foreign investor, enters a share pledge agreement ‘in respect of their shares in the Borrower in favour of the Security Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 18). The Share Pledge Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not publicly available, so it is unknown under what circumstances ownership in the project company could be transferred from the foreign investor to the creditors. (b) Mortgage over Assets: The Borrower enters a mortgage agreement over ‘equipment and other assets of the Borrower in relation to the Project […] in favour of the Finance Parties, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 13). The Mortgage Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not public, so it is unknown which assets are pledged. (c) Other security documents which evidence or create ‘security over any asset of the Borrower to secure any obligation of the Borrower under the Finance Documents’ (p. 17). Since no other security documents are publicly available, no further details are known. In addition to the Security Documents, the Facility Agreement references an Account Agreement. Again, this is a separate document that is not publicly available. Cross references in the Facility Agreement show that ICBC and China Eximbank can designate ‘a bank outside the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone’ at which the ‘Bank Accounts are opened and maintained’ (p. 1). The conditions of utilization further reveal that the Borrower is required to transfer project revenue into this account so that the account balance at all times meets the minimum debt service coverage of ‘all principal scheduled to be paid and all interested expected to be payable under the Facility on the next Interest Payment Date’ (p. 16). In addition, the repayment of the loan is fully guaranteed by Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance. In particular, the Ministry ‘guarantees to ensure that if […] the balance of the Borrower Collection Account falls to an amount that is less than is required to meet the next Scheduled Debt Service payment […], the Guarantor shall pay, or procure to be paid, into that account, such amount as may be necessary to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the amount of the next Scheduled Debt Service payment’ (p. 143). The Concession Agreement specifies that ‘the Concessionaire shall be entitled to create Security over its rights, title, and interest in the Port Development Levy Fees and the New Port Assets in favor of the Finance Parties for the purpose of the Financing provided that any such Security shall not continue for a period exceeding the Concession Term. The Concessionaire may enter into all such transactions, and may become party to the related debt obligations that may be evidenced or secured by the Finance Documents.’ Through the agreement, the Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets.’ The concession agreement defines the ‘New Port’ as ‘four (4) Berths, and container, bulk Cargo or vehicle handling facilities (including quay walls and other infrastructure and superstructure and all fixtures, fittings and machinery, apparatus, equipment and any other moveable assets of any nature), navigation and navaid facilities, storage yards or warehouse, or any ancillary or auxiliary works relating to such Berths to be developed and constructed by the Concessionaire at the Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown Siena Leone’; ‘New Port Assets’ as ‘any and all machinery and equipment attached to the land within the Exclusive Area and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the Concessionaire in connection with the New Port’; the ‘Existing Port Development Levy Fee’ as ‘the fees charged by the Concessionaire to the Existing Port Carriers in connection with the use of the Existing Port by the Existing Port Carriers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Existing Port Development Levy Fee Act; the ‘New Port Development Levy Fee’ as the fee charged by the Concessionaire to the New Port Carriers in connection with the transhipment of containers, bulk Cargos or vehicles at the New Port by are New Port Carriers in accordance with the term of this Agreement and the New Port Development Levy Fee Act’; ‘Port Development Levy Fees’ as ‘the Existing Port Development Levy Fee and the New Port Development Levy Fee’; and ‘Security’ as ‘mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, or other security interest securing any obligation of any Person or any other agreement or arrangement having a similar effect.’ The Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets’. The Concession Agreement also specifies that the lenders all have security over the ‘insurance proceeds until all sums due and owing by the Concessionaire to the Finance Parties shall have been paid in full.’ 9.

Since no other security documents are publicly available, no further details are known. In addition to the Security Documents, the Facility Agreement references an Account Agreement. Again, this is a separate document that is not publicly available. Cross references in the Facility Agreement show that ICBC and China Eximbank can designate ‘a bank outside the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone’ at which the ‘Bank Accounts are opened and maintained’ (p. 1).

In addition, the repayment of the loan is fully guaranteed by Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance. In particular, the Ministry ‘guarantees to ensure that if […] the balance of the Borrower Collection Account falls to an amount that is less than is required to meet the next Scheduled Debt Service payment […], the Guarantor shall pay, or procure to be paid, into that account, such amount as may be necessary to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the amount of the next Scheduled Debt Service payment’ (p. 143). The Concession Agreement specifies that ‘the Concessionaire shall be entitled to create Security over its rights, title, and interest in the Port Development Levy Fees and the New Port Assets in favor of the Finance Parties for the purpose of the Financing provided that any such Security shall not continue for a period exceeding the Concession Term. The Concessionaire may enter into all such transactions, and may become party to the related debt obligations that may be evidenced or secured by the Finance Documents.’ Through the agreement, the Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets.’ The concession agreement defines the ‘New Port’ as ‘four (4) Berths, and container, bulk Cargo or vehicle handling facilities (including quay walls and other infrastructure and superstructure and all fixtures, fittings and machinery, apparatus, equipment and any other moveable assets of any nature), navigation and navaid facilities, storage yards or warehouse, or any ancillary or auxiliary works relating to such Berths to be developed and constructed by the Concessionaire at the Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown Siena Leone’; ‘New Port Assets’ as ‘any and all machinery and equipment attached to the land within the Exclusive Area and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the Concessionaire in connection with the New Port’; the ‘Existing Port Development Levy Fee’ as ‘the fees charged by the Concessionaire to the Existing Port Carriers in connection with the use of the Existing Port by the Existing Port Carriers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Existing Port Development Levy Fee Act; the ‘New Port Development Levy Fee’ as the fee charged by the Concessionaire to the New Port Carriers in connection with the transhipment of containers, bulk Cargos or vehicles at the New Port by are New Port Carriers in accordance with the term of this Agreement and the New Port Development Levy Fee Act’; ‘Port Development Levy Fees’ as ‘the Existing Port Development Levy Fee and the New Port Development Levy Fee’; and ‘Security’ as ‘mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, or other security interest securing any obligation of any Person or any other agreement or arrangement having a similar effect.’ The Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets’.

62224,"China Eximbank contributes $130 million to $659 million syndicated loan for Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project (Linked to to Project ID#62222, #62223) On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies — consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. — regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as ‘Queen Elizabeth II Port’). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidfore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books. 1. This project is also known as the Queen Elizabeth II Quay Upgrading Project.

AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (5.126%) by adding 3.5% to average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (November 2017) when the loan agreement was finalized (1.626%).3. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020.4. No sources explicitly state that this is a buyer's credit loan. AidData assumes this is the case for the following reasons: (1) The loan is provided to a foreign borrower, (2) the loan is denominated in USD, (3) the face value of the loan is explicitly identified in multiple official sources, (4) the loan is used to finance a commercial contract with a Chinese company, and (5) the loan was insured by Sinosure via its export buyer's credit insurance service, which is specifically used when banks are providing buyer's credit financing.5.

58385,"China Development Bank provides $1.5 billion loan to Eskom for 4800MW Medupi Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#52560) On July 6, 2017, China Development Bank and the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) — South Africa's state-owned electric power company — signed a $1.5 billion (ZAR 20 billion) loan agreement. The loan is payable over a 15-year period and it has a five-year drawdown period. Its estimated interest rate is 3.7149%. The Government of South Africa issued a sovereign guarantee in support of loan. By the end of 2022, the loan’s estimated disbursement rate was 83.62%.   The purpose of the project was to construction Medupi Power Plant (Medupi 发电厂项目) in Lephalale, Limpopo Province. The plant consists of six units (boilers) with a total capacity of 4800 MW. The project also involved the construction of the Ngwedi substation. The project’s total estimated cost is $11.31 billion.   Hitachi, Alstrom, and WSP Global were the contractors responsible for project implementation and management. The first structural concrete was poured on July 18, 2008. The Ngwedi substation transformer was officially commissioned in December 2016. By July 2017, Unit 1 was at full production capacity and Unit 2 was close to full capacity. In June 2019, Eskom reported that Unit 3 had reached full load on May 16, 2018 (796MW) and was first synchronized to the national grid on April 8, 2018. Unit 3 followed Units 6, 5 and 4, which have been commercially contributing electricity to the national grid since August 23, 2015 (U6), April 3, 2017 (U5) and November 28, 2017 (U4). The power plant achieved commercial operation status on July 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the 4800MW Medupi Power Plant Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In February 2019, the CEO of Eskom was asked the following question by a reporter: 'Can you indicate and comment in general terms on the World Bank, DBSA, China Development Bank and other DFI loan covenants, and what may be considered a breach, such as failure to meet required going concern status, debt service coverage ratio and/or other metrics?' He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics — interest cover, debt service cover, and so on. When we do find ourselves in a situation where we will not meet these requirements, many of the terms do allow us to put forward an action plan on how it’s going to be resolved.' Then, in February 2023, South Africa’s National Treasury announced that it would would take on ZAR 254 billion ($14 billion) of Eskom's ZAR 423 billion debt that was at risk of default, to enable the state-owned power utility to pay down its principal and interest obligations. 1. This project is also known as the 6X794MW Medupi Coal Power Plant Expansion Project.2. The annual financial statements of Eskom demonstrate that the China Development Bank disbursed $3,763,000,000 to Eskom between 2017 and 2022 (under the $1.5 billion loan agreement captured via Project ID#58385, the $2.5 billion loan agreement captured via Project ID#58379, and the $500 million loan agreement captured via Project ID#52560): a $500 million disbursement in 2017, a $650 million disbursement in 2018, a $900 million disbursement in 2019, a $938 disbursement in 2020, a $455 million disbursement in 2021, and $320 million disbursement in 2022.

The purpose of the project is contribute to improving the incomes of people of the Kairouan, Kasserine and Sidi Bouzid Governorates through agricultural value chain development. The main expected achievements of the project are as follows: (i) improvement of cropping techniques and increase in yields by 20 to 30% and produce quality; (ii) access to financing through existing mechanisms for the 15 Mutual Agricultural Services Societies (SMSA) set up; (iii) capacity building for 23 Agricultural Development Cooperatives (GDA) for the efficient management of water and irrigation infrastructure and rehabilitation of irrigation areas over a total of 9,000 ha; (iv) support for the establishment and building of the capacity of 15 Mutual Agricultural Services Societies (SMSA); (v) financial support for these SMSAs by contributing to the financing of sub-projects in value chain development (input sales points, soil work equipment, harvesting equipment, cold stores, agricultural produce processing); women’s SMSAs will be the first beneficiaries of this support; (vi) support for SMSAs in produce labelling for 1,000 farmers; (vii) development of 32 km of rural roads to facilitate access to production areas and markets.   The project will pursue its objective by implementing three project components: the Rehabilitation of Infrastructure and Improvement of Agricultural Productivity Component, the Produce Development and Marketing Component, and the Project Coordination and Management Component. The Rehabilitation of Infrastructure and Improvement of Agricultural Productivity Component involves (i) rehabilitation of 20 irrigation areas on 9,000 ha; (ii) provision of water-saving equipment for all irrigation areas on 9,000 ha; (iii) improvement of cropping techniques and increase in yields of about 30% and produce quality through advice; (iv) dissemination of improved technologies and best practices on demonstration plots in the irrigation areas; (v) preparation of a catalogue of resilient technologies and agricultural practices; (vi) preparation, publication and distribution of an environmental management best practices guide for irrigation areas and training of actors on this guide ; (vii) Access to financing, especially through tripartite contracts (SMSA-BTS-private operator) and/or microfinance for at least 10 SMSAs out of the 20 that will be established under the project; (viii) access of 15 SMSAs to FOSDA financial incentives; and (ix) capacity building for 23 GDAs in efficient water and irrigation infrastructure management.   The Produce Development and Marketing Component comprises: (i) support for Mutual Agricultural Services Societies (SMSA) through technical assistance. This support will assist farmers in the establishment and building of the institutional capacity of 15 SMSAs, the preparation of a business plan for each SMSA, with specific support in this area for 5 women’s SMSAs, support for the appraisal of a specific priority sub-project to be financed by the project for each SMSA established and, lastly, support through advisory services in business plan and sub-project implementation. At the end of this support, SMSAs should be able to organize their supply of inputs and the collective marketing of their crops (especially apples, tomatoes and olives) instead of passing through intermediaries as is the case now, thus achieving economies of scale and improving their bargaining capacity. Lastly, they should have a business plan and priority sub-projects in the networks of value chains of their interest, and be able to seek and obtain financing through investment law incentives and from banks directly, or under tripartite contracts (SMSAs-private operators-banks); (ii) logistical support through the construction of premises for 15 SMSAs; (iii) financial support through contribution to the financing of sub-projects in value chain development (input sales points, soil work equipment, harvesting/threshing equipment, cold stores, agricultural produce processing) for 15 SMSAs; women’s SMSAs already active in processing will be the first beneficiaries of this support; (iv) support for SMSAs in the labelling of their produce and, in particular, the promotion of the status of indication of origin (SI) of Sbiba apple for the benefit of 1,000 farmers in this irrigation area;; support for SMSAs will only concern organisations with a significant number of members (v) the development of 32 km of agricultural roads to facilitate access to production areas.   The Project Coordination and Management Component involves (i) preparation of work plans, annual budgets and progress reports; (ii) project and ESMP implementation monitoring; (iii) monitoring of project outcomes and impact, including gender mainstreaming (activities, results, impacts); (iv) project administrative, accounting and financial management; (v) procurement of project goods, works and services; and (vi) annual audits.    The project seeks to directly benefit 3,558 households or about 20,000 persons, more than 50% of whom are women. Project implementation commenced in June 2018. The project’s originally scheduled completion date was June 30, 2023. However, according to the AFDB, the project has encountered various implementation problems, including policy coordination problems, an inability of the project coordination unit to manage complex problems involving a multiplicity of stakeholders, delays in the procurement process linked to the capacities of the members of the project coordination unit, and the slow pace of loan disbursements.  1.

57536,"China Eximbank participates in $1.53 billion syndicated buyer’s credit for 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydropower Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#89492 and #92289) On August 10, 2010, the China-Africa Development Fund (CADF), Sinohydro Corporation Ltd., and the Government of Zambia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract for the Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Station Project. The project was designed to address a power deficit in Zambia. It would involve the construction of a 140-meter high concrete-face rock fill dam (CFRD) with a length of approximately 378 meters. A surface powerhouse and five generator units would also be built. It was originally envisaged that the project would be completed by 2021 and created approximately 5,000 jobs. China Development Bank (CDB) was slated to provided financing to the project. The total cost of the project was reported to be $2 billion at the time. China’s Ministry of Commerce announced that a commencement ceremony for the project was scheduled for July 20, 2011.   However, after a change of government in 2011, Zambia’s incoming Minister of Finance questioned whether the project would be sufficiently beneficial to Zambia and whether there were adequate transparency and control mechanisms in place. He wanted a second opinion regarding the technical solutions proposed by the Chinese side. The Government of Norway was asked to review the plans and give further advice, but the Norwegian Government did not wish to be involved. The Government of Zambia nevertheless decided to ‘unpack’ the original proposal and looked for alternative funding and investors. It suspended its MOU with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and CADF.   However, after an open tendering process, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. re-won the EPC contract on October 19, 2015. The project was ultimately financed as a public-private partnership (PPP) with a 85:15 debt-to-equity ratio. A special purpose vehicle called the Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited (KGLPDC) was created to manage the implementation of this PPP. It is wholly-owned by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited, a state-owned power company. Then, on November 13, 2017, Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited signed a $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Plant Construction Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. ZESCO Limited reportedly agreed to cover the remaining 15% through an equity contribution, even though it had already made an $186 million equity investment in the project (with some of the proceeds from a $750 million Eurobond issuance in September 2012). China Eximbank’s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#57536 and ICBC’s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#92289. The final facility (loan) agreement included 87 loan conditions, none of which has been made public. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly pushed to help the Government of Zambia complete all conditions before the syndicate would commit to finalizing the facility agreement. Zambia’s Ministry of Finance provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and Sinosure provided a credit insurance policy (which cost the borrower approximately $100 million).   The loan had disbursed $479,000,000 as of June 21, 2018, $551,291,040 as of December 31, 2018, $887,520,697 as of December 31, 2019, $932,015,102 as of December 31, 2020, and $1,200,000,000 as of January 2020. The loan’s amount outstanding was $965,692,012 (inclusive of $16,843,994 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2021, $981,586,149 (inclusive of $32,738,132 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022, and $993,836,899 (inclusive of $44,988,881 in interest arrears) as of December 31, 2022.  Construction began on January 15, 2016. However, the first loan disbursement (worth $479 million) from China Eximbank and ICBC did not occur until June 21, 2018. ZESCO Limited also hired a Norwegian private company, Norconsult, to act as its technical advisor and quality controller to ensure that Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and other contractors honor their contractual obligations and international standards. BelFone Communications was contracted to a wireless communication system for the plant. Significant progress was made between 2016 and 2019: the North Western Province was connected to the national electricity grid following the commissioning of a 132 KV transmission line; costly diesel generation machines were decommissioned; and other transmission lines were completed to support mining projects in the region. The project had achieved a 72% completion rate by early 2020. However, the project experienced major delays in late 2019 when Sinohydro announced that it was halting its work due to the fact that it had not been paid for its services. Also, in later 2019 and early 2020, ICBC was reportedly reluctant to continue making loan disbursements due to the fact that the Government of Zambia had defaulted on its repayment obligations to several other external creditors.  Then, in January 2020, China’s Ambassador to Zambia refuted reports by Africa Confidential that the project’s lenders had suspended disbursements, resulting in a stoppage of works at the hydropower plant.  However, later that year, KGLPDC defaulted on its repayment obligations under the facility (buyer’s credit) agreement with ICBC and China Eximbank. Given that the buyer’s credit was insured by Sinosure, the EPC contractor (Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.) sought compensation through an indemnity payment. In January 2021, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. filed an insurance claim with Sinosure, which in turn made an indemnity payment (worth $57.23 million) to Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. in May 2021.   The COVID-19 pandemic and major cost overruns also led to project implementation delays. The cost of the EPC contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly increased from $1.48 billion to $2 billion, and interest payments worth $312 million during the grace period were reportedly capitalized so that the borrower would not have to make loan repayments until the power plant began generating revenue. In July 2021, during the middle of Zambia’s presidential election campaign season, one of the five turbines (Turbine Number 2) of the 750 MW Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant was commercially commissioned and it began to supply 150 MW to the national grid. As of April 2022, ZESCO reported that two turbines at the power plant were operational and producing 300 megawatts while a third turbine was undergoing a reliability test, but there was an apparent lack of activity at the project site and neither China Eximbank nor ICBC were making any loan disbursements.  Then, in June 2022, Zambia's Energy Minister Peter Kapala announced that Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited had defaulted on its repayment obligations to China Eximbank and ICBC, and it was seeking to reschedule and restructure its outstanding debts to the Chinese creditors. He also announced that ZESCO would use internal revenues to complete the project and ensure that all turbines came online. One month later, in July 2022, China’s Ambassador to Zambia, Du Xiaohui, referred to the Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant as a ‘a money printer made in China’ that could potentially early $1 million a day. On March 24, 2023, the fifth turbine was launched and the entire project was officially commissioned in a ceremony attended by President of Zambia Hakainde Hichilema.

Most sources, including SAIS-CARI, records the face value of the loan as $1.5 billion. However, the exact face value of the loan (i.e. transaction amount) reported by AidData ($1,530,576,039.16) comes from a 2019 report from the Zambian legislature (source ID#99467 p. 15). 3a. The borrowing terms of the $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer’s credit facility from China Eximbank and ICBC are unknown. However, on May 6, 2016, Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) issued a $100 million loan for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Plant Construction Project with a 15-year maturity, a 2-year grace period, and interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.933% in May 2016) plus a 9.4% margin. For the time being, AidData assumes that the same borrowing terms applied to the $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC. This issue warrants further investigation. 3b. A 2011 World Bank study of the project estimated that the loan for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydropower Plant Construction Project would likely carry a 9% interest rate, a 16 year maturity, and a 6 year grace period.

On May 17, 2018, Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited signed a $195,766,479.52 loan agreement with ICBC for the engineering, procurement and construction of three 330kV transmission lines and associated facilities to evacuate power from the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant. This loan is captured via Project ID#89492). 5. The exact size of Eximbank and ICBC’s respective financial contributions to the $1.53 billion syndicated buyer's credit facility agreement are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that the 2 members of the syndicate contributed equal amounts ($765,288,019.58).6. Given that the Dubai (DIFC) Branch of ICBC served as the security agent for the ICBC/China Eximbank loan agreement (see https://www.zambialaws.com/Zambia2018Pdfsi/SI%2037%20of%202018.pdf) and the project was financed through an SPV with a project finance transaction structure, the ICBC/China Eximbank loan was almost certainly collateralized. According to a September 2020 IMF publication (IMF Country Report No. 22/292), 'based on latest available data, as of end-December 2021, there was $2.4 billion of disbursed external foreign-currency debt with some form of security or escrow arrangement that could be considered as collateralized debt, including debt with a government guarantee or third-party (exporter) guarantee as security. All this debt is in arrears and, where the security or escrow provides for a claim on funds in a specific account, the authorities have reported zero balances in those accounts. Debt is collateralized when the creditor has rights over an asset or revenue stream that would allow it, if the borrower defaults on its payment obligations, to rely on the asset or revenue stream to secure repayment of the debt. Collateralization entails a borrower granting liens over specific existing assets or future receivables to a lender as security against repayment of the loan. Collateral is 'unrelated' when it has no relationship to a project financed by the loan. An example would be borrowing to finance the budget deficit, collateralized by oil revenue receipts.'7. When lenders take collateral as security for their loans, a collateral/security agent is often appointed to enforce rights against the collateral in the event of the borrower’s default under the loan.",True,0.9238461
57560,"ICBC provides $35.25 million loan for Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant Upgrading Project (Linked to Project ID#57565, #66848) On January 26, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $35.25 million loan facility agreement with ZESCO Limited — Zambia’s state-owned power company — for the Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant Upgrading Project. The loan carries the following terms: 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 4.69% interest rate (LIBOR plus 335 basis points) per annum. As of December 31, 2017, the loan's amount outstanding was $29.9 million.  The Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant  is located in Musonda Falls within Mwense District and Luapula Province. It is a source of power supply to seven districts in the province—namely, Chiengi, Kawambwa, Mwense, Chipili, Chembe, Nchelenge and Samfya. The purpose of this project was to upgrade the Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant from 5MW to 10MW. This increase in local power capacity also added to the national grid capacity, thereby supporting the fishing industry, farming activities and potential mining activities in nearby communities.   In 2015, Sinohydro won the 18-month contract for project implementation. Sinohydro had previously provided two bridging loans in 2015 (as captured via Project ID#57565) and 2016 (as captured via Project ID#66848) for the same project. As of 2017, this project had achieved a 99% completion rate. Turbine-Generator Units 6 and 7 had completed their commissioning tests and reliability runs, but commissioning tests and reliability runs for Turbine-Generator Units 1 to 5 were still ongoing by the end of 2017. The scheduled project handover date of November 18, 2017 was not achieved. However, a 2018 Energy Sector Report published by Zambia’s Energy Regulation Board (ERG) indicates that ‘[t]he increase in [power] generation in 2018 is attributed to the [upgrading] of Musonda Falls Power Station’, which suggests that this hydroelectric power plant project was completed and put into operation in 2018.  1. The Chinese project title is 穆松达水电站7台机组 共10MW. 2. The all-in interest rate was calculated as follows: 1.34% (Average 6-month USD LIBOR from Jan. 2017) + 3.35% (335 basis points) = 4.69%3. In the SAIS-CARI China Loans to Africa database released in July 2020, this loan has an 18-year maturity length. However, AidData records the maturity length as 15 years because the audited 2017 financial statements of ZESCO Limited (the borrower) note that “[t]he loan shall be repaid over a 15 year period including a grace period of 3 years” (see source ID 67341 p. 40). 4.

The loan carries the following terms: a 15-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 335 basis points. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial contract between ZESCO Limited, Jiangsu Etern Co. and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd., which was signed on or around October 2014.  As of December 31, 2017, the loan's amount outstanding was $7.4 million.   The purpose of this 2-part project was to connect Lundazi and Chama districts to the Zambian national power grid because residents were receiving unreliable power from ESCOM Malawi. It involved the construction of a 305 km, 132 kv transmission line from the Chipata sub-station to Chama via Mwansephangwe, Lundazi, Eggichickeni (Chief Magodis area) as well as four new 33kv substations in Mwasemphangwe, Lundazi, Egichikeni and Chama.   Jiangsu Etern Co. and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. The first down payments to the two contractors were made in 2016, thus enabling the preliminary design works to commence. According to the ZESCO's 2017 Integrated Report (source ID 114272 p. 62), Sinohydro Corporation Ltd mobilized to the site and commenced works during 2017. However, Jiangsu Etern was still awaiting issuance of a Government of Zambia sovereign guarantee to achieve financial close. It expected to mobilize in the first quarter of 2018. Both projects were scheduled to last 18 months. By the end of 2018, the project had achieved a 40% completion rate. One of the transmissions lines was connected to grid on December 16, 2019. The project as a whole was completed on or around February 21, 2021. 1.

The borrowing terms of the $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer’s credit facility from China Eximbank and ICBC are unknown. However, on May 6, 2016, Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) issued a $100 million loan for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Plant Construction Project with a 15-year maturity, a 2-year grace period, and interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.933% in May 2016) plus a 9.4% margin. For the time being, AidData assumes that the same borrowing terms applied to the $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC. This issue warrants further investigation.   3b. A 2011 World Bank study of the project estimated that the loan for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydropower Plant Construction Project would likely carry a 9% interest rate, a 16 year maturity, and a 6 year grace period.

On May 17, 2018, Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited signed a $195,766,479.52 loan agreement with ICBC for the engineering, procurement and construction of three 330kV transmission lines and associated facilities to evacuate power from the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant. This loan is captured via Project ID#89492).   5. The exact size of Eximbank and ICBC’s respective financial contributions to the $1.53 billion syndicated buyer's credit facility agreement are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that the 2 members of the syndicate contributed equal amounts ($765,288,019.58).  6. Given that the Dubai (DIFC) Branch of ICBC served as the security agent for the ICBC/China Eximbank loan agreement (see https://www.zambialaws.com/Zambia2018Pdfsi/SI%2037%20of%202018.pdf) and the project was financed through an SPV with a project finance transaction structure, the ICBC/China Eximbank loan was almost certainly collateralized. According to a September 2020 IMF publication (IMF Country Report No. 22/292), 'based on latest available data, as of end-December 2021, there was $2.4 billion of disbursed external foreign-currency debt with some form of security or escrow arrangement that could be considered as collateralized debt, including debt with a government guarantee or third-party (exporter) guarantee as security. All this debt is in arrears and, where the security or escrow provides for a claim on funds in a specific account, the authorities have reported zero balances in those accounts. Debt is collateralized when the creditor has rights over an asset or revenue stream that would allow it, if the borrower defaults on its payment obligations, to rely on the asset or revenue stream to secure repayment of the debt. Collateralization entails a borrower granting liens over specific existing assets or future receivables to a lender as security against repayment of the loan. Collateral is 'unrelated' when it has no relationship to a project financed by the loan. An example would be borrowing to finance the budget deficit, collateralized by oil revenue receipts.'  7. When lenders take collateral as security for their loans, a collateral/security agent is often appointed to enforce rights against the collateral in the event of the borrower’s default under the loan.",True,0.92271227

2170,"China Eximbank provides $551.08 million debt financing package for 147MW Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to #58671, #58674, and #68762) In 2004, the Government of Togo and the Government of Benin hoped to begin construction of the 147MW Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant but a disagreement over the terms of financing took years to resolve. On January 26, 2008, an MoU was signed between China Hydropower Group International Corporation and the Government of Benin for the possible construction of the power plant.   In 2009, Sinohydro and Communauté Electrique du Bénin (CEB) — an inter-governmental organization (owned by the Government of Benin and the Government of Togo) that is responsible for developing electricity infrastructure in Togo and Benin and reducing these countries’ dependence upon Ghana for energy imports — signed a $388 million commercial contract for the 47MW Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. However, in order to cover additional project costs, the Government of Benin turned to international donor organizations — including the World Bank, African Development Bank, and others — in 2013. These organizations expressed initial interest in financing the project, seemingly until the United States began to oppose funding for large new dams worldwide. Ultimately, the international donor community opted not to support the project and China Eximbank subsequently pledged a financing package worth $551.08 million (captured via this umbrella project, ID#2170).   On December 15, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Benin signed a $211.31 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The PBC carries the following terms: 20-year maturity, 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. Then, on July 12, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Benin signed an RMB 400 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The GCL carries the following terms: 20-year maturity, 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. China Eximbank also signed a $61 million loan agreement with the Government of Togo on May 23, 2016 for this project. The PBC is captured in Project ID#58674 and the GCL is captured in Project ID#58671. The loan issued to the Government of Togo is captured in Project ID#68762. The proceeds from these three loans were on-lent by the Government of Benin and the Government of Togo to CEB. CEB used these loan proceeds to finance a FCFA 265,814,526,897 commercial contract that it signed with Sinohydro on April 25, 2014.    This project involves the construction of a dam in Adjarala, which is located approximately 100 km downstream of the 65MW Nangbéto hydropower plant on the Mono River. The dam will stand 40 meters tall, with a 3.7 long kilometer reservoir. The project also involves the construction of 252 kilometers of 161 KV high voltage power transmission lines, water diversion systems, plants, access roads and other ancillary facilities. The ultimate objective of the project is to strengthen regional energy interconnection and alleviate electric power shortages in Benin and Togo.   Sinohydro is the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 26, 2015. Then, in December 2016, the project was suspended after the Togolese Minister of Economy and Finance announced that there were insufficient financial resources to complete the project. The project resumed in January 2017, and as of September 2017 it was still under construction. This project is also known as the 3x49MW Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it identifies a single $229 million “concessional loan” from China Eximbank to the Government of Benin for this project. However, the Government of Benin’s Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) records two separate loans from China Eximbank: a $211.31 million preferential buyer’s credit and an RMB 400 million government concessional loan. These two loans were independently ratified by Benin’s Parliament, and in May 2018 email correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Coordinator of the IMF Program in Benin’s Ministry of Economy, and Finance confirmed the receipt of two separate China Eximbank loans for the 147MW Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.

53063,"CDB provides $10 billion to Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol and prepay outstanding debts (Linked to Project ID#66847, #87051, 95415) On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017.    As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The proceeds of the loan facility were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.    In 2016, China Development Bank approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility (captured via Project ID#53063) to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol — Angola’s state-owned oil company — and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (captured via Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (captured via Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (captured via Project ID#47103).     According to the IMF, the $6.9 billion that was on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the $10 billion subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of it was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing. According to the IMF, after this recapitalization, Sonangol ‘significantly reduced its external debt, which [was] projected to decline to about US$5 billion at end-2018, from US$12.9 billion at end-2015.’ Therefore, rather than having the country’s state-owned oil company struggle to pay back CDB loans that were coming due, the Government of Angola effectively moved Sonangol’s CDB debts onto its own balance sheet.  There are clear indications that the December 2015 CDB loan financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023. 1. There is a discrepancy in the reported value of on-lending to Sonangol between two official sources: the IMF 2017 Article IV Staff Report and the Government of Angola’s November 2019 bond prospectus. The former suggests that the central government on-lent $6.9 million and the latter suggests that the central government on-lent $10 billion. For the time being, AidData relies on the Government of Angola’s November 2019 bond prospectus for the total amount on-lent to Sonangol and relies on the IMF’s 2017 Article IV Staff Report for the breakdown of the $10 billion. AidData assumes for the time being that the Government of Angola on-lent $10 billion to Sonangol, of which $3.1 billion was used to refinance Sonangol’s existing CDB debts. Therefore, AidData has coded the transaction (financial commitment) amount as $6.9 billion to avoid double-counting CDB loans that Sonangol previously contracted. 2. In the Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) Database that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020 and updated in March 2021 (which is now maintained by Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center), a $10 billion loan from CDB to the Government of Angola is recorded to captured the recapitalization of Sonangol. The CLA database does not expunge the portion of the loan ($3.1 billion) that was used to refinance Sonangol’s existing CDB debts. 3. AidData Project ID#87051 captures the portion of the loan used for re-financing, though no transaction amount has been recorded.  4. Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.5. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015.

The facility has a maturity of 15 years, and the Government of Angola is not required to make any repayments under the facility until the end of the disbursement period, which ends sixty months after the effective date of the facility (meaning the grace period is 5 years). The Government of Angola did not issue a sovereign guarantee for the loan, but China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) provided an export credit insurance policy for the facility and Eximbank provided 85% of the premium. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance up to 85% of the price of a commercial contract between Caioporto, S.A. and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).  Caioporto, S.A. is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established and owned by the Government of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) for the financing, construction and management of a deep-water commercial port in the village of Caio within Cabinda Province.  The only equity in this project was provided by a $180 million investment from Angola's Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA) and an unknown investment amount by Quantum Global Group, an investment group founded by Swiss-Angolan Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais.  The Port of Caio Construction Project is being implemented in multiple phases.  The first phase involves the construction a 630 meter seaport wall, a 2 km bridge and access pier to the seaport terminal with 2km length, a 180 meter access channel, and a 200 meter-wide, 14 meter-deep docking basin.  The second phase involves the construction of a 200 meter-wide, 18 meter-deep access channel and a docking pier that is 1,130 meters long and 16 meters deep with the capacity to dock 4 large ships simultaneously and welcome some of the world’s largest ships.  Upon completion, the port will have the capacity to move about 60 containers per hour.  The project will cover an area of over 2,500 hectares, where customs facilities, workshops with port support and ship repair services, warehouses and commercial establishments will be built.  Phase 1 construction began in June 2017; however, as of March 2022, no funds had been disbursed through the China Eximbank facility agreement.  Then, on May 30, 2018, the contract for the project was halted by Presidential Order No. 66/18, effectively terminating the execution of the port project between Caioporto, S.A. and Angola’s Ministry of Transport. A year later, Presidential Order No. 166/19 halted the commission for the termination of the port project (in effect, undoing Presidential Order No. 66/18 and reactivating the project) and authorized the Angolan Minister of Transport to grant one of the port terminals of Porto do Caio to Caioporto, S.A. to guarantee the implementation of the project. Presidential Order No. 166/19 also made Caioporto, S.A. entirely owned by the Government of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) after Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais (who was removed from his position at Fundo Soberano de Angola on suspicions of financial mismanagement) returned his assets to the Angolan Government.

87051,"CDB provides loan to Sonangol for debt refinancing purposes (Linked to Project ID#66847, #95415, #53063) On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017.    As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The proceeds of the loan facility were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.    In 2016, China Development Bank approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility (captured via Project ID#53063) to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol — Angola’s state-owned oil company — and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (captured via Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (captured via Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (captured via Project ID#47103).     According to the IMF, the $6.9 billion that was on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the $10 billion subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of it was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing. According to the IMF, after this recapitalization, Sonangol ‘significantly reduced its external debt, which [was] projected to decline to about US$5 billion at end-2018, from US$12.9 billion at end-2015.’ Therefore, rather than having the country’s state-owned oil company struggle to pay back CDB loans that were coming due, the Government of Angola effectively moved Sonangol’s CDB debts onto its own balance sheet.  There are clear indications that the December 2015 CDB loan financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023. 1. There is a discrepancy in the reported value of on-lending to Sonangol between two official sources: the IMF 2017 Article IV Staff Report and the Government of Angola’s November 2019 bond prospectus. The former suggests that the central government on-lent $6.9 million and the latter suggests that the central government on-lent $10 billion. For the time being, AidData relies on the Government of Angola’s November 2019 bond prospectus for the total amount on-lent to Sonangol and relies on the IMF’s 2017 Article IV Staff Report for the breakdown of the $10 billion. AidData assumes for the time being that the Government of Angola on-lent $10 billion to Sonangol, of which $3.1 billion was used to refinance Sonangol’s existing CDB debts. Therefore, AidData has coded the transaction (financial commitment) amount as $6.9 billion to avoid double-counting CDB loans that Sonangol previously contracted. 2. In the Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) Database that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020 and updated in March 2021 (which is now maintained by Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center), a $10 billion loan from CDB to the Government of Angola is recorded to captured the recapitalization of Sonangol. The CLA database does not expunge the portion of the loan ($3.1 billion) that was used to refinance Sonangol’s existing CDB debts. 3. AidData Project ID#87051 captures the portion of the loan used for re-financing, though no transaction (financial commitment) amount has been recorded.  4. Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.5. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015.

The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.  Then, on July 12, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Benin signed an RMB 400 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.  The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.  China Eximbank also signed an RMB 250 million ($61 million) loan agreement with the Government of Togo on May 23, 2016 for the Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.   The PBC is captured via Project ID#58674, and the GCL is captured vis Project ID#58671.  The loan issued to the Government of Togo is captured in Project ID#68762.  The proceeds from these three loans are to be used by the borrowers to finance a FCFA 265,814,526,897 commercial contract between la Communauté Electrique du Bénin (CEB) and Sinohydro, which was signed on April 25, 2014.  This project involves the construction of a dam in Adjarala, which is located approximately 100 km downstream of the 65MW Nangbéto hydropower plant on the Mono River.  The dam will stand 40 meters tall, with a 3.7 long kilometer reservoir.  The project also involves the construction of 252 kilometers of 161 KV high voltage power transmission lines, water diversion systems, plants, access roads and other ancillary facilities.  The ultimate objective of the project is to strengthen regional energy interconnection and alleviate electric power shortages in Benin and Togo.  Sinohydro is the contractor responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 26, 2015.  Then, in December 2016, the project was suspended after the Togolese Minister of Economy and Finance announced that there were insufficient financial resources to complete the project.  The project resumed in January 2017, and as of September 2017 it was still under construction. It is expected to reach completion by 2020. 1.

52494,"ICBC provides $302.9 million loan for 75 MW Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project On July 28, 2016, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Government of Cameroon signed a $302,944,727 loan agreement [ID# ICBC18072016] for the 75 MW Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 17-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 1.75% margin. It also appears to be supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy.  As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 0% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 162.5 billion).   The purpose of the project is construct a 75MW hydroelectric dam on Bini a Warak located in the Adamawa Region of Cameroon. The project involves the construction of a reservoir, tunnels, powerhouses, substations, 70 km, 225 kilovolts (kV) electricity transmission (energy evacuation) lines, 30kv rural electricity transmission lines, access roads, and related infrastructure, the installation of generators, turbines and related equipment. The project initially took shape in 2008 as a result of a US Trade and Development grant (worth $662,000), which established the viability of the project.   Delphos International was appointed as the feasibility study consultant, and an environmental and social impact assessment was conducted by Naldeo and Alpha Technologies Inc. Then, after the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2012, a commercial contract for the project was signed in 2013 between Ministère de l'Eau et de l'Energie du Cameroun (MINEE) and Sinohydro Corporation. The final project design was completed in November 2013, and construction began in October 2017. Preparatory works, site installation activities, access road construction activities, and dyke construction activities were completed by the end of 2018.  However, the project underperformed and stalled in 2019. In November 2019, the Government of Cameroon paid XAF 4 billion in outstanding credit insurance fees (presumably to Sinosure), which it had hoped would unlock loan disbursements from ICBC. However, ICBC did not respond by releasing any loan disbursements. Project implementation was also at a 'standstill' for much of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of November 2020, the project had only achieved a 9% completion rate. It was rescheduled for completion in 2024.   Then, during his address before the National Assembly on June 28, 2021, Cameroonian Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the project. He noted that it had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.' As of December 2021, Cameroon’s MINEE was still negotiating with ICBC to try to facilitate the resumption of project implementation (which is dependent upon ICBC making an advance payment to Sinohydro). Several project milestones were also accomplished in 2021: the implementation activities of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the transmission line were completed; and decrees were issued to facilitate payment of compensation to the people affected by the project. Upon completion, it is expected that the 560hm3 dam will have installed energy capacity of 75 MW and a 225Kv energy transmission line. 1. The Chinese project title is 比尼瓦拉克水电站工程 or WARAK水电站项目.

Also, SAIS-CARI identifies the face value of the loan as $289 million, but the Government of Cameroon's Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements and the Government of Cameroon's Development Assistance Database (DAD) indicates that the face value of the loan is $302,944,727. AidData records the face value that is reported in the DAD. 4. The project ID number for this transaction in DAD is CAM/001023. 5. Although several sources refer to this project being ‘suspended’, this appears to be a layman’s explanation for ICBC’s unwillingness to release an advance payment to Sinohyrdro. For the time being, AidData is treating this project as one that is backed by an official commitment and undergoing implementation (since negotiations over ICBC loan disbursements are evidently still underway). However, the status designation of this project will need to be revisited once these negotiations come to a close. 6. The ‘all-in’ interest rate was calculated using the average 6-month EURIBOR in July 2016 (-0.188% + 1.75% = 1.562%). 7.

58582,"China Eximbank provides RMB 937,500,000 government concessional loan for E-National Higher Education Network Project In 2012, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) reported that the Cameroonian Ministry of Higher Education signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Cameroonian subsidiary of China Communications Services Corporation (the parent company of Sichuan Telecom Construction Engineering Co., Ltd), in which it was determined that China Communications Services Corporation would undertake feasibility studies, environmental assessments, and construction for the E-National Higher Education Network Project. In 2015, MOFCOM reported that an intergovernmental framework agreement for the project had been signed in Beijing but was still awaiting the Cameroonian President’s authorization of the loan agreement before the project could officially commence. On July 27, 2016, the Cameroonian President issued a decree authorizing the Cameroonian Minister of the Economy, Planning, and Regional Development to sign a loan with China Eximbank for the E-National Higher Education Network Project. Then, on August 22, 2016, China Eximbank and the Republic of Cameroon signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 11 TOTAL NO. (550)] worth RMB 937,500,000 for the E-National Higher Education Network Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a commitment fee of 0.25%, and a management fee of 0.25%. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment.   The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $150,000,000 commercial contract between the Ministry of Higher Education of the Republic of Cameroon and Sichuan Telecom Construction Engineering Co., Ltd, which was signed on February 20, 2013 (as well as the Complementary Agreement and Complementary Agreement II that the two parties signed on November 26, 2013 and April 8, 2014, respectively). The first loan disbursement (worth 30% of the face value of the loan) was released on June 5, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 80.7% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 4.9 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 72.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to facilitate the establishment of a computer network for higher education, and to provide a digital campus development center for eight universities in Cameroon. The first component of this project is a 'one child, one computer' initiative, for which China is providing Cameroon students with 500,000 laptops. This component of the project costs 50 billion FCFA, and it was expected to be complete by 2019. The second component of the project involves the construction, equipment and commissioning of nine University Digital Development Centers (one in each State University and one at the Cameroon-Congo Inter-State University, Sangmelima Campus). This part of the project costs 25 billion FCFA, and together both components are worth 75 billion FCFA (which is equivalent to the total amount of the project and the total amount financed by China Eximbank). Project implementation commenced on November 26, 2017. As of July 2021, project implementation was still underway.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the E-National Higher Education Network Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.

This loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 25-year maturity, a 15-year grace-period, and a 0% interest rate. It is scheduled for repayment between December 1, 2029 and November 30, 2039. In addition to this loan, this stadium project was financed by an additional grant and interest-free loan from the Chinese Government:   (1) a CFA 11.9 billion grant provided in March 2017 (captured via Project ID#85370), and  (2) a CFA 20.69 million interest-free loan issued on February 22, 2016 (captured via Project ID#73441).   The loan and grant proceeds were to be used to finance an RMB 750,000,000 (CFA 63,990,243,240) commercial contract [ID#2016-0-2-1417/02-29 between Ivorian Government and Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG), which was signed on July 22, 2016. The Ivorian Government was responsible for providing CFA 4 billion of counterpart financing for earthworks and the installation of water, electrical and telecommunications infrastructure at the project site.  This project involved the construction of a 60,012 seat stadium in Ebimpé within the Anyama sub-prefecture. It also involved the construction of an Olympic village surrounding the stadium, which has 4 housing estates, a training complex, administrative buildings, a commercial area, a clinic, a 4-star hotel, a 9-hole golf course, and of a medium voltage power line (15 kV) dedicated to the stadium (from the Yopougon 2 HV/MV transformer station to the industrial zone). Additionally, it involved the construction of a 10,000 seat multi-purpose arena.   Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG) was the contractor responsible for implementation. It hired approximately 1000 workers, of which 350 were Chinese and 650 were Ivorian. Project implementation commenced on December 10, 2016. Then, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 22, 2016 (originally planned for January 2016). Shortly thereafter, on December 31, 2016, the Chinese Government made a loan disbursement worth CFA 14 billion. An electrical connection for the project site was established on August 18, 2017.  Foundation pile construction was completed on September 26, 2017. Construction was expected to last 24 months and project was originally expected to reach completion on October 21, 2019.When the Ivorian Minister of Sports inspected the construction site in August 2018, the project had achieved a 50% completion rate and its expected completion (delivery) date had been pushed back to November 21, 2019.  An opening ceremony for the stadium took place on October 3, 2020. It was completed in advance of the the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations football (soccer) tournament. According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the project encountered several problems during implementation, including ‘bad behavior’ among Chinese team leaders towards the workers on the project site, a lack of protective equipment for workers, a worker strike on October 23, 2017 for better wages and improved working conditions, and non-compliance with the contractual deadlines for the execution of the project. 1.

According to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the Chinese Government provided CFA 67,319,989,326 (or approximately RMB 714.6 million) in total funding for this project. Therefore, AidData assumes that the face value of the interest-free loan contracted on February 22, 2016 is equivalent to the difference (CFA 20.69 billion) between that aggregate amount (CFA 67.3 billion) and the sum of the November 2014 loan amount (CFA 25.71 billion or RMB 300 million) of the March 2017 grant amount (CFA 11.9 billion). However, it is possible that the value of the interest-free loan is slightly higher than CFA 20.69 billion.

The PBC (captured via Project ID#59375) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.50% management fee. The Djiboutian legislature ratified the PBC agreement on June 7, 2016. According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the PBC (loan) ultimately achieved a 89.2% disbursement rate (FDJ 54,594,000,000). The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial contract (No. PDSA-GHDC-01) worth $476,779,000.42 that was signed by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), and Port of Djibouti S.A. (PDSA) on August 16, 2014. PDSA is a joint venture between the Government of Dijbouti (76.5% equity stake) and China Merchants Group (23.5% equity stake). PDSA was responsible for the remainder ($132,306,173.17) of the commercial contract cost.   In 2016, PDSA also obtained a $50 million loan (captured via Project ID#91872 from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for the Doraleh Multipurpose Port Project. The Government of Djibouti issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the ICBC loan on May 3, 2016.   The objective of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port (DMP) was to relieve pressure on the Port of Djibouti SA as the pace of trade between Africa and the rest of the world increased. More specifically, the DMP project component was designed to expand the existing port's capacity by adding seven new berths in the first phase, including a roll on/roll off facility, with a total length of 1,200 meters. Each berth was meant to accommodate ships with cargoes of up to 100,000 tons in a naturally deep-water bay that will require minimal dredging. Upon completion, the designed annual throughput of bulk cargo volume and the container volume were to be 7.08 million tons and 200,000 TEU, respectively. The livestock port at Damerjog, located in the Arta region 13 km south-east of the capital, was meant to comprise a quay 655 meters long for up to five ships and a holding area for 150,000 head of livestock. The ultimate objective of this component of the project was to create a livestock port with an anticipated capacity of 10 million heads of livestock per year that could export livestock from Ethiopia and South Sudan to the Gulf countries and North Africa.   CCECC and CSCEC were the contractors responsible for project implementation.  A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on September 8, 2013. However, construction at the DMP did not begin until August 2014. Construction at the livestock port at Damerjog commenced on October 26, 2014. Construction activities ended in February 2017. The DMP was formally inaugurated on May 24, 2017 and then put into use in July 2018. This project has been plagued by controversy. In 2004, DP World acquired a 33.4-percent stake in the Doraleh Container Terminal SA (DCT). Then, on October 30, 2006, the Republic of Djibouti, DCT and Dubai International (Djibouti) FZE signed a concession agreement that granted Dubai International (Djibouti) FZE — a subsidiary of DP World — the exclusive right to design, build and manage the terminal. DCT commenced operations on December 15, 2008 (though it was formally inaugurated on February 7, 2009) as the first deep-water terminal in Africa that could permit ships of 15,000 TEU to dock alongside.   However, the relationship between DP World and the Republic of Djibouti eventually deteriorated and the Republic of Djibouti initiated discussions with China about the possibility of developing a greenfield multi-purpose port adjacent to DCT. In early 2013, China Merchants Group and its affiliates agreed with Djibouti to develop, build, and operate a new multipurpose port, bulk terminal, crude oil terminal and ship repair yard in order to transform the old port of Djibouti. On February 5, 2013, CMPort’s wholly-owned subsidiary, China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE, acquired 23.5% equity stake in Port De Djibouti S.A. (PDSA) for $185 million to participate in the restructuring of the Port de Djibouti. However, DCT’s consent was never sought at any point in time prior to, or during, the construction and development phase of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port (DMP). Mr. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman, Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA), took the position that the Republic of Djibouti did not need to take DCT’s consent as the DMP was not an “additional” container handling facility, but a “replacement” for the Old Port.  DP World commenced arbitration proceedings against the Republic of Djibouti in the London Court of International Arbitration on July 8, 2014. The London Court of International Arbitration eventually found the Republic of Djibouti to be in breach of its agreement with DP World and issued a ruling on March 19, 2019 ordering it to pay $385.7 million (plus interest) as compensation to DP World.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer's credit for Phase 1 of Doraleh Multipurpose Port and the Damerjog Livestock Export Terminal Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million in March 2020. Then, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.  1.

On February 5, 2013, CMPort’s wholly-owned subsidiary, China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE, acquired 23.5% equity stake in Port De Djibouti S.A. (PDSA) for $185 million to participate in the restructuring of the Port de Djibouti. However, DCT’s consent was never sought at any point in time prior to, or during, the construction and development phase of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port (DMP). Mr. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman, Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA), took the position that the Republic of Djibouti did not need to take DCT’s consent as the DMP was not an “additional” container handling facility, but a “replacement” for the Old Port.  DP World commenced arbitration proceedings against the Republic of Djibouti in the London Court of International Arbitration on July 8, 2014. The London Court of International Arbitration eventually found the Republic of Djibouti to be in breach of its agreement with DP World and issued a ruling on March 19, 2019 ordering it to pay $385.7 million (plus interest) as compensation to DP World. 1.

In 2020, Mr. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman, Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA), tweeted about a Chinese loan for the DMP Construction Project (https://twitter.com/omar_hadi/status/1247581160164724744?s=20) and referenced an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 1.8% margin, 20 year maturity, and 7 year grace period. For the time being, AidData assumes that these are the borrowing terms which apply to the ICBC loan.

52881,"CDB provides $1 billion loan to strengthen the country’s foreign reserves and preserve macroeconomic stability (Linked to Project ID#52882 and ID#89462) On January 23, 2016, the President of China, Xi Jinping, and the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, signed a liquidity support facility (LSF) agreement wherein China Development Bank agreed to provide a $1 billion loan to the Central Bank of Egypt. The loan, captured via Project ID#52881, was reportedly provided on the following terms: an 11-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate of 4.7352%.   The purpose of the loan was to help the Central Bank of Egypt shore up the country’s foreign exchange reserves in the face of pressure on the Egyptian pound. According to CDB, its Qingdao Branch and the CDB Cairo Representative Office organized a $900 million disbursement shortly after the LSF agreement was signed. Reporting from the Central Bank of Egypt suggests that CDB subsequently ‘upsized’ the face value of the liquidity support facility agreement from $1 billion to $2 billion. However, the precise timing of this increase in the face value of the loan is unknown.   The Central Bank of Egypt reports that the amount outstanding under the LSF was $1.8 billion in September 2019, $1.5 billion in September 2020, $1.6 billion in December 2020, $1.3 billion in March 2021, $1.3 billion in June 2021, $1.1 billion in September 2021, $1.1 billion in December 2021, $842.9 million in March 2022, $817.8 million in June 2022, $560.5 million as of September 2022, and $567.2 million in December 2022. 1. According to the Chinese Government, the Qingdao Branch of CDB provided an RMB 7 billion (approximately $1 billion) loan to the Central Bank of Egypt in 2018.  For the time being, AidData has coded the commitment year for the $1 billion LSF upsizing as 2018.  2. The Chinese project title is 央行10亿美元授信项目. 3.

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI published in July 2020 and the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, the face value of this CDB loan is identified as $1 billion. AidData relies on the $2 billion face value that is reported by the Central Bank of Egypt for the time being. However, it is possible that the $2 billion face value of the liquidity support facility agreement that is reported by the Central Bank of Egypt reflects the receipt of an additional RMB 8 billion CDB loan (埃及央行70亿人民币授信项目) in 2018 (which is reported by multiple sources, including China’s Ministry of Commerce).

The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the loan under Proclamation No.988/2017 on December 27, 2016 and the proclamation went into effect on January 3. 2017. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2.6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee.  The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 50% of the total cost of a ETB 4,168,889,036.14 commercial (EPC) contract between Addis Ababa Roads Authority (AACRA) and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). The remainder of the commercial contract cost is expected to be directly financed from the budget of City Administration of Addis Ababa.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $102,736,147.53  (ETB 2,286,586,782) loan achieved a 38% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 861,595,457 on March 28, 2018.   The purpose of this project is support the construction of two subsidiary projects (‘Lot 1’ and ‘Lot 2’). Lot 1 involves the construction of the 11 km Qality-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road Interchange (also known as the Kality Ring Road Interchange - Tulu Dimtu Roundabout and the Qality Ring Road Interchange-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road), which is located on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. Lot 1 also involves the construction of five bridges as well as the Akaki Bridge. Lot 2 involves the construction of the 10.6 km Qality Ring Road to Qilinto Road (also known as the Kality Ring Road - Kilinto Roundabout and Bole Bulbula project and the Qality ring road to Qilinto road project). Lot 2 will connect Bole Michael ring road and Qality ring road and thereby provide for easy transportation route for the goods from the Qilinto industrial zone. This road segment is also expected to be useful for the condominium residents in the area. Lot 2 also involves the construction of a 250 meter-span bridge as well as an underpass bridge. Since both road segments (Lots 1 and 2) are located in areas that are important for trade, they are expected to improve market access for small businesses and industrial parks.   IFH Engineering plc — a wholly owned subsidiary of the CCCC — is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and its work is being overseen by AACRA. ASER Construction also worked as a subcontractor for CCCC. Engineer Zewdie Eskinder and Company Plc. is responsible for providing consulting services for Lot 1. Hake Consultant Company is responsible for providing consulting services for Lot 2. A groundbreaking ceremony for Lot 1 and Lot 2 took place on February 14, 2017. As of April 2021, Lot 1 had achieved a 76% completion rate.   However, this project has faced local scrutiny and criticism due to the fact that it was reportedly among the most expensive road projects to ever be undertaken (in unit cost terms) in Ethiopia. Lot 1 costs ETB 222.7 million per kilometer of road and Lot 2 costs ETB 219.8 million per kilometer of road.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Qality Ring Road Interchange Tulu Dimtu Roundabout Road and Qality Ring Road Bulbula-Qilinto Roundabout Road Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

The loan carries the following terms: a 10 year maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.058%) + a 3% margin (or 4.058%). The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a July 3, 2015 commercial contract between the Government of Gabon, China State Construction Engineering Group Corp LTD, and Shanghai Construction Group.   The project involved the construction of a stadium in Oyem with 20,500 seats and field size of 105 x 68m.    China State Construction Engineering Group Corp LTD and Shanghai Construction Group were the contractors responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 2, 2015 and the project was completed in advance of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations football tournament. The stadium was officially inaugurated on January 9, 2017.  There are some indications that the ICBC loan for the Oyem Stadium Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).

Bank of China reportedly contributed $84.5 million to the loan syndicate. The loan carried a 12-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was secured with (i.e. collateralized against) revenues from gas sales deposited in a government disbursement account (GDA) and a reserve escrow account (REA) with 4.5 months of the estimated gas revenues.   The project was also supported by a $300 million loan from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a $310 million loan from UK Export Finance (UKEF) facility, a $180 million MIGA-covered commercial bank facility, and a $90 million UKEF-backed commercial bank facility. Sankofa Gas Project is an integrated offshore oil and natural gas project that sought to provide a source of reliable, affordable energy to Ghana.   The Sankofa Gas Project sought to develop the offshore Sankofa gas field (桑科法油气田) within the offshore cape three points (OCTP) block in Western Ghana. It involved the drilling of 5-6 gas production (development) wells; the laying of offshore pipeline; the creation of onshore gas pipeline link to onshore power plants; and the construction of a 2.5 km onshore interconnection link with the existing West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) to enable supply of Sankofa gas to power plants in Ghana’s Eastern region. The project was completed in December 2018. It faced a number of difficulties during and after implementation.   The first gas supplies from the Sankofa field to thermal power plants started in June 2018. However, the first gas supplies did not occur until August 2018, and then in much smaller volumes, for the following reasons: (i) the market for gas in the western region of the country close to landfall was limited by two factors: (a) gas demand in the western region (Takoradi) was not sufficient to offtake the contracted volume of Sankofa gas; and (b) associated gas supplies being produced from the nearby Jubilee and TEN fields, and averaging 50 mmscfd in the 2nd half of 2019, were given first preference; and (c) without the availability of a pipeline interconnection linking gas supplied from Sankofa to the eastern region of the country, the size of the market was limited to Takoradi. 1.

The proceeds of both GCLs were to be used by the borrower to finance one or more commercial contracts with Huawei Technologies. Co. Ltd. The purpose of the project was to construct 2100 km of national optic fibre backbone infrastructure, which passes through eight major towns and 36 districts.   Huawei Technologies. Co. Ltd is the general contractor responsible for project implementation. However, the Government of Kenya’s State Department is also implementing the project in conjunction with Information and Communications Technology Authority (ICTA). Construction began on September 22, 2014. According to the Kenyan Aid Management Platform, the NOFBI project was originally expected to reach completion by June 30, 2016. However, as of February 2021, the project was still not complete.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the NOFBI and E-Government Expansion Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a Kenyan government audit, ‘the NOFBI project network has been operational since 2014 and has been used by most of the data service providers in the [c]ountry. However, although the financing agreement [with China Eximbank] indicated that the Government [of Kenya] would sell out excess capacity commercially to the public and bill them to finance the loan repayments, there has been no billing done over the last five […] years it has been in operation. Further, the Service Provision Framework Agreement between the NOFBI Project Managers and the Internet Service Providers has not been implemented. The Government [of Kenya] has, therefore, been funding the operations of commercial entities without recovering the cost which amounts to lack of prudent use of public resources. In addition, no records have been provided detailing the users that have been connected to NOFBI for the last five […] years, their utilization levels, and the amount payable by each.'   This project has also become a target of parliamentary scrutiny and controversy. On May 11, 2021, James Opiyo Wandayi, a member of the Kenyan parliament, said ‘[d]uring this financial year that we are reviewing, the case of National Optic Fibre Backbone Infrastructure (NOFBI) came to us. This is a project which, of course, was well intended, and I still believe it is well intended even as we speak. It is a project that has cost taxpayers a [whopping] Kshs21 billion and still counting. This is because the last phase of it is still under implementation. This is one project that was conceived and implemented in the most opaque manner and in blatant disregard of the existing laws. If you look at the first phase of this project, it cost taxpayers Kshs4.2 billion. For those who do not know, this is the project that was supposed to enhance internet connectivity across the country. It was supposed to lay down the trunks, infrastructure, and highways for internet from Nairobi to the countryside. The first phase of this project cost taxpayers Kshs4.2 billion and it was, indeed, fully funded by the Government of Kenya. There was some attempt to undertake an open tendering process and, as a result of this, three companies were contracted. These were Huawei, a company from China and two other local companies. They were contracted to undertake that project. However, when that project entered the second phase, which cost taxpayers Kshs7.2 billion, there is no evidence how the company that was eventually contracted was ever contracted. There was no evidence how that company came on board. We have laboured through and through to find out how that company came on board. Incidentally, the same company did the first phase - that is Huawei Technologies. We were at pains to understand how a contract of Kshs7.2 billion could have been awarded to a company on the basis of nothing really. There was no open tendering, no direct procurement as we know it under the law, and there was no restricted tendering. They were citing some nebulous terminology of government-to-government tendering procurement process, which is not known in any law. Moreover, it is an issue that is still left pending. However, even more seriously, the same company was awarded another contract to implement the third phase of this project, now at a [whopping] Kshs9.8 billion. This is what they are calling Phase 2 expansion of the NOFBI Project. Still, we are unable to find out how that company was awarded that contract and how it was procured. Indeed, for both Phase 2 and Phase 2 expansion of this project, the company that was awarded the contract was unable to produce even a letter of award. We struggled to get the letter of award that was given to the company. We could not lay our hands on any. Nobody was willing to go on record that they are responsible for the procurement of this company. Therefore, that is just one example. However, just to conclude on that particular aspect of NOFBI Project, there was the matter of revenues that would then be generated from this project, especially Phase 1 which was completed. There was some [loose] agreement that was purportedly entered into between the Information, Communication and Technology Ministry and Telkom Kenya that would allow Telkom Kenya to be collecting revenue as it carries out maintenance on the infrastructure. However, the profits that would be realised would then be channeled to an escrow account, which would then help the country and the public to pay back the loans that were procured from China. As we speak, eight or so years down the line, no single cent has been deposited in the escrow account. It therefore means that the public is going to continue to carry this burden of the debt from other sources and yet, there is money that is being generated from that project. This is because we know - and there was evidence - that Telkom Kenya was charging the commercial data service providers such as Safaricom, Orange and many others. Therefore, when Telkom Kenya came before us, they were not shy. They just told us: “It is true we have been collecting money.” Indeed, they admitted that they had by that time collected up to about Kshs1.7 billion. However, they were not going to remit anything to the Government of Kenya on account of the fact that the costs they had incurred in maintaining this infrastructure was more than what they had collected. However, there was no independent authority or entity that had audited their accounts with regard to this revenue collection from the NOFBI infrastructure.’ 1.

China Eximbank and the Government of Malawi subsequently signed an RMB 155,432,330.40 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase I of the Malawi National Fibre Backbone Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 21, 2036), a 6.25 year grace period (first repayment date: March 21, 2022), and a 2% interest rate. Malawi's Parliament then ratified the loan agreement on December 6, 2016 through Bill No. 31 of 2016 [Export and Import Bank of China (National Fibre Backbone Project) Loan (Authorisation)].   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 155,432,330.40 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 10,362,155.36 until 2036.   The fiber optic backbone will be deployed using Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi (ESCOM) power transmission towers. The project is expected to lay 1,220 km of fiber optic cables from the northern border district of Chitipa to Nsanje in the south, through Lilongwe, Blantyre and Zomba. The project will connect 24 districts (out of the country's total 28 districts) with drop points at the Capital Hill in Lilongwe, Blantyre Government Office Complex and Zomba Government's Offices at the District Commissioner's Office.  The project will also involve the installing communication equipment to enable internet connectivity and help the government integrate and optimize its Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS), Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS), and the Immigration and National Registration and Identification System.      The ultimate objective of the project is to connect all major sectors of the economy and government agencies in the country to a high speed optical fiber based network. Once the national network is completed, high-speed internet will be directed mostly to the Capital Hill in Lilongwe, to the government offices in Blantyre and to those in Zomba. The total fiber optic cable network will cover 4,000 km, 1,220 km of which are part of this project. The remaining 2,780 km is part of ESCOM's current network.   Huawei was responsible for implementing the project in collaboration with ESCOM. The project was originally expected to reach completion on June 30, 2022. The Government of Malawi announced that the project had reached completion on February 2, 2018.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase I of the Malawi National Fibre Backbone Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2021, Malawi's Minister of Finance announced that ‘in 2020/21 FY, Government [of Malawi] requested temporary debt service suspension from bilateral creditors. This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In July 2023 correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Government of Malawi revealed that it was in negotiations with China Eximbank about rescheduling all of their loans with amounts outstanding. The Government of Malawi proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 50 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 90 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 89 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 88 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 87 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 86 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 85 million in principal and interest payments in 2032.

The objective of the project is provision of adequate transmission capacity to cater for the projected demand from within 4 industrial park areas. The project has 4 components: (1) Construction of Luzira Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (15 km); (2) Construction of Mukono Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (5 km); (3) Construction of Iganga Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (10 km); and (4) Construction of Namanve Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (5 km).   China CAMCE Engineering Co. Ltd is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project officially commenced implementation on June 29, 2016. The first disbursement through the loan took place on January 25, 2017. Another loan disbursement took place on December 20, 2018. As of April 7, 2020, the Aid Management Platform (AMP) of the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development recorded a total loan disbursement value of $52,763,088.16.

This project has encountered multiple obstacles and delays during implementation. First, due to compensation delays that arose from the wetland ownership queries and a notice to cancel the titles within the wetland, one of the wetland claimants went ahead and built a printery at the terminal tower spot of the Luzira transmission line corridor. Second, an increase in a nearby lake’s water level has affected the Luzira wetland, thus making construction harder for the contractor. (The Luzira transmission line corridor is located in Luzira wetland; therefore, access to the tower spots has proven very difficult during construction of tower foundations and tower erection.) Third, as of October 26, 2021, there were still right of way (RoW) acquisition issues at Luzira Port Bell Market, Miami Beach, Kilombe and Panda PL Villages.

52463,"China Development Bank provides $170 million loan for Solar-Powered Milling Plants Project (Linked to Project ID#87538) In 2015 during Zambian President Edgar Lungu's state visit to China, the Chinese Government and the Government of Zambia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on a Solar-Powered Milling Plant Project. Then, on July 22, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Zambia’s Ministry of Finance signed a $170 million loan agreement for the Solar-Powered Milling Plants Project. The loan reportedly carries a 12-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points. It is backed by a Sinsoure credit insurance policy. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Zambia Cooperative Federation (ZCF) created a special account into which various agricultural cooperatives (participating in the project and benefiting from the solar-powered milling plants) were required to deposit 1,700 kwachas (about $100) per month for a period of 15 years. At the end of the 15-year period, the solar-powered milling plants will become the property of the various agricultural cooperatives. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of $200 million commercial contract between ZCF and Shandong Dejian Group (also known as Shandong Dejian Group Co., Ltd.). The Government of Zambia is responsible for providing the remaining $30 million in counterpart financing.   As of December 2018, CDB had released $150 million and the Government of Zambia had released $20 million in support of this project. The project involves the construction of 1,000-2,000 milling plants — using solar-powered equipment purchased from China — in remote areas without electricity in eight Zambian provinces (Lusaka, Muchinga, Central Province, Luapula, Copperbelt, North Western, Western and Southern Provinces). The project was also expected to create 4,749 long-term stable jobs. Shandong Dejian Group is the contractor responsible for project implementation and its work is being overseen by Zambia Cooperative Federation (ZCF), which is the project owner. Construction began on March 6, 2017. However, a formal groundbreaking ceremony did not place until April 17, 2019. As of December 2016, 250 milling plants had been constructed. As of December 2018, 1,300 milling plants had been constructed. Ultimately, it is expected that 2,000 milling plants will be constructed. These milling plants are expected to create about 3,000 jobs and help stabilize the price of mealie-meal, from which the Zambians prepare their staple food, nshima. In January 2019, Xinhua reported that 1,830 solar-powered milling plants out of the planned 2,000 had been constructed. However, in October 2020, ZCF project director Derek Sokoni reported that 1,571 milling plants were up and running (in 79 regions across 10 provinces).   Official Chinese sources characterize the project as a major success, arguing that it “brought an end to the current state of producing cornmeal by manual labor and guaranteed local food supply” and “its success […] led to a drop of 1/3 in the price of food.” They also note that the project’s solar power technologies have resulted in “annual average reduction of 27,633 tons of carbon dioxide.” However Zambian media have reported that many of the plants were ‘white elephants’ and provided poor value-for-money. In December 2021, one Zambian media outlet reported that half of the 307 Zambia Cooperative Federation (ZCF) solar-powered milling plants in Eastern Province had stopped working, several were abandoned by cooperatives, and 30% had solar panels stolen.

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 5-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The principal amount was scheduled to be repaid in equal semi-annual installments after the end of the 5-year grace period. The PBC was to be repaid from dividends receivable from Topstar Communications Company Ltd. or ZNBC revenues (deposited in an escrow account). Future dividends receivable from Topstar Communications Company Ltd. also served as a source of collateral (security) for the loan.   As of July 2022, the loan had achieved a 83% disbursement rate ($192,735,724.78 out of $232,181,138.85).

The on-lending (subsidiary) loan agreement was finalized on February 10, 2017. Topstar Communications Company Ltd. is a special purpose vehicle and a joint venture between ZNBC (40% equity stake) and StarTimes (60% equity stake), which was established on May 12, 2016. The proceeds of the $232,181,138.85 PBC were to be used to finance 85% of the cost of a $273,154,281 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services and Star Times Communication Network Technology Co. Ltd (Star Times), which was signed on September 18, 2015. China Eximbank expected the Government of Zambia to directly finance the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost. However, due to debt mismanagement challenges, StarTimes ultimately covered this cost by providing a $41 million supplier's credit (loan) to the Government of Zambia in 2017 (captured via Project ID#56827).   This project involved the the supply, delivery, installation and commissioning of a National Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting System. More specifically, it involved the design, manufacture and installation of plant and equipment and construction and commissioning buildings (studios) in Chinsali, Kasama, Mansa, Kabwe, Mongu and Chipata districts. The establishment of Topstar Communications Company Ltd. as a joint venture involved (1) the provision of digital television (TV) signal transmission service for TV stations and charge transmission fee; (2) the provision of decoders of Set-Top-Boxes (STBs) for every household with a TV set; (2) the provision to each subscriber, a basic television package of not less than twenty five channels which include local TV and international programs, and charge a monthly maintenance subscription fee of US$3 tax exclusive; (4) the provision a basic television package at half price to the poor families identified by government as such; and (5) the provision of two free channels for digital television universal access to viewers who fail to pay monthly maintenance subscription of US$3.  Star Times was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.   This project was officially completed and handed over the local authorities at a ceremony that was held on June 14, 2019. However, a physical inspection that was carried out in November 2020 revealed four major implementation problems: (1) Although the July 2020 project status report revealed that civil works at the Kasama Studio were completed and the site handed over by the contractor, a visit to the site revealed that it was not operational as equipment had not yet been installed. (2) Although the project status report for October 2020 stated that the civil works at the Chinsali studio were completed and the site handed over by the contractor, a visit to the site revealed that it was not operational as equipment had not been installed. (3) The July 2020 status report revealed that the civil works at the Kabwe Studio had only achieved an 83% completion rate (with remaining works including fitting of fixtures and fittings, aluminium at the entrance, supply generator, connection of power, paving the car park, tiling of the outside step, plumbing works and completion of the generator storage room) and works had stalled and the contractor was not on site. (4) The October 2020 status report revealed that the civil works at the Chipata studio had only achieved an 82% completion rate (with remaining works including fitting of fixtures and fittings and aluminum at the entrance of the building, connection of power and paving of the car park) and works had stalled and the contractor was not on site. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the $232,181,138.85 loan’s undisbursed balance ($39,445,414.07); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. 1.

Future dividends receivable from Topstar Communications Company Ltd. also served as a source of collateral (security) for the loan. As of July 2022, the loan had achieved a 83% disbursement rate ($192,735,724.78 out of $232,181,138.85). As a condition precedent to the loan agreement becoming effective, the Government of Zambia was required to on-lend 63.5% of the proceeds from the PBC (worth $147,434,528.10) to Topstar Communications Company Ltd. (captured via Project ID#56816) and on-lend 36.5% of the PBC proceeds (worth $84,746,610.75) to Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) (captured via Project ID#56767). The on-lending (subsidiary) loan agreement was finalized on February 10, 2017. Topstar Communications Company Ltd. is a special purpose vehicle and a joint venture between ZNBC (40% equity stake) and StarTimes (60% equity stake), which was established on May 12, 2016.   The proceeds of the $232,181,138.85 PBC were to be used to finance 85% of the cost of a $273,154,281 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services and Star Times Communication Network Technology Co. Ltd (Star Times), which was signed on September 18, 2015. China Eximbank expected the Government of Zambia to directly finance the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost. However, due to debt mismanagement challenges, StarTimes ultimately covered this cost by providing a $41 million supplier's credit (loan) to the Government of Zambia in 2017 (captured via Project ID#56827). This project involved the the supply, delivery, installation and commissioning of a National Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting System. More specifically, it involved the design, manufacture and installation of plant and equipment and construction and commissioning buildings (studios) in Chinsali, Kasama, Mansa, Kabwe, Mongu and Chipata districts. The establishment of Topstar Communications Company Ltd. as a joint venture involved (1) the provision of digital television (TV) signal transmission service for TV stations and charge transmission fee; (2) the provision of decoders of Set-Top-Boxes (STBs) for every household with a TV set; (2) the provision to each subscriber, a basic television package of not less than twenty five channels which include local TV and international programs, and charge a monthly maintenance subscription fee of US$3 tax exclusive; (4) the provision a basic television package at half price to the poor families identified by government as such; and (5) the provision of two free channels for digital television universal access to viewers who fail to pay monthly maintenance subscription of US$3.  Star Times was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.   This project was officially completed and handed over the local authorities at a ceremony that was held on June 14, 2019. However, a physical inspection that was carried out in November 2020 revealed four major implementation problems: (1) Although the July 2020 project status report revealed that civil works at the Kasama Studio were completed and the site handed over by the contractor, a visit to the site revealed that it was not operational as equipment had not yet been installed. (2) Although the project status report for October 2020 stated that the civil works at the Chinsali studio were completed and the site handed over by the contractor, a visit to the site revealed that it was not operational as equipment had not been installed. (3) The July 2020 status report revealed that the civil works at the Kabwe Studio had only achieved an 83% completion rate (with remaining works including fitting of fixtures and fittings, aluminium at the entrance, supply generator, connection of power, paving the car park, tiling of the outside step, plumbing works and completion of the generator storage room) and works had stalled and the contractor was not on site. (4) The October 2020 status report revealed that the civil works at the Chipata studio had only achieved an 82% completion rate (with remaining works including fitting of fixtures and fittings and aluminum at the entrance of the building, connection of power and paving of the car park) and works had stalled and the contractor was not on site. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the $232,181,138.85 loan’s undisbursed balance ($39,445,414.07); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. 1.

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it records a $93 million preferential buyer’s credit to Topstar Communications Company Ltd. in 2015 with the following terms (25 year maturity and 5 year maturity). It does not record an interest rate. The face value, year of commitment, and maturity length that SAIS-CARI records for this PBC is inconsistent with the loan details published by Zambia’s Auditor General in its “Accounts of Parastatal Bodies and Other Statutory Institutions for the Financial Years Ended 31 December 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016' (source ID#117326).

Phase I was financed by Zambia's Treasury in 2016 amounting to $9.5 million. 4. On May 12, 2016, ZNBC and Star Times Communication Network Technology Co. Ltd (Star Times) entered into an agreement to invest in and establish a joint venture limited liability company called TopStar Communications Company Ltd. ZNBC and Star Times were to own 40% and 60% of the company, respectively, during the initial twenty five years. After that period of time, ZNBC would maintain 40% shareholding with Star Times having 30%, Public Institutions 20% and the general public (Zambians) having the remaining 10%. 5. On May 30, 2018, ZNBC (borrower) entered into a loan agreement of $400,000 with Startimes (lender) to finance the 40% shareholding in TopStar. Under the terms of the loan agreement, the lender agreed to directly transfer the required amount to Topstar Communications Company Ltd. on behalf of ZNBC.  The loan agreement also specified that that loan would be effective from the date of transfer of funds by Startimes to TopStar on behalf on ZNBC; the loan would run for five years; the loan would be repaid from dividends receivable from Topstar Communications Company Ltd. or ZNBC revenues; and future dividends from Topstar Communications Company Ltd. would constitute loan security (collateral).5.

56970,"Bank of China contributes $332 million to $381.7 million syndicated loan tranche — via EPC+F arrangement — for Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project On June 5, 2013, China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CNCEC) — a subsidiary of CMEC — signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Government of Zambia for water supply projects in Copperbelt Province. One of these projects was the Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project. Then, on July 11, 2016, Bank of China and Standard Chartered signed a $449,090,629.71 syndicated (EPC+F) loan agreement with CNCEC for the Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project. The loan was provided in two separate tranches and backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from the Government of Zambia’s Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP). As part of the first ($381,727,035.28) tranche, Bank of China contributed approximately $332 million (captured via Project ID#56970) and Standard Chartered contributed approximately $50 million. This loan tranche has a 15-year maturity. Sinosure provided political and commercial risk insurance for 95% of the principal and interest under this loan tranche. As of July 2022, the $381,727,035.28 syndicated loan tranche had achieved a 58.8% disbursement rate ($224,609,249.30 out of $381,727,035.28). Standard Chartered also provided the second tranche worth $67.3 million with a 4-year maturity. The proceeds of these two loan tranches were use to finance 100% of the cost of a $449,090,629.71 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia’s Ministry of Local Government and Housing with China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CNCEC), which was signed in February 2016.    This project involves the construction of a reservoir dam at Kafulafuta with a 125 million cubic meter storage capacity, a water intake pumping station, a midway booster pumping station, an independent water supply system in Mupenggui region, a transmission main line from the dam to Ndola, and waterlines from the Kafulafuta dam to Msayiti (V.), Luanshya and Ndola water works. It also involves the upgrading and reconstruction of a city pipe network, the procurement of domestic water meters and regional water meters, and resettlement engineering activities. The project is expected to create 3,000 jobs and improve water access and quality for 700,000 people in the Ndola, Luanshya and Masaiti districts. The dam site is located in Ibenga area of Masaiti District of the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. It lies 50km west of Ndola City. The site is within Her Royal Highness Chieftainess Malembeka and His Royal Highness Senior Chief Mushili.   Project implementation began in August 2017. However, a formal project commencement ceremony did not take place until September 21, 2018. Then, in June 2019, a shipment of 3,336 tons of building materials — including water pipelines — arrived  via the Port of Walvis Bay in Namibia. According to Zambia's Ministry of Water and Sanitation Development as of September 11, 2019, the project had achieved a 55% completion rate. On February 5, 2020, CNCEC notified the Zambian Government that it was halting work on the project due to overdue payments, which would leave 450 employees and 50 subcontractors out of work. Japhen Mwakalombe, Zambia’s Minister of the Copperbelt province, disputed this point, arguing that the work stoppage was because of heavy rains in the area. Then, in November 2021, Kafubu Water and Sanitation Company (KWSC) Director of Engineering Bernard Phiri reported that the stalled project was being affected by rampant vandalism and theft. Valves and other water installations from the project site were reportedly stolen and vandalized. The project was originally scheduled for completion in January 2021. However, as of February 2022, AidData had identified no evidence of project completion.   On July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the undisbursed balance ($157,117,785.98) of the $381,727,035.28 syndicated loan tranche; however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action.

57556,"ICBC provides $29.6 million loan for Mpika Power Supply Improvement Project (Linked to Project ID#57492) On July 13, 2016, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited — Zambia’s state-owned power company — signed a $29.6 million (seller's credit) facility agreement for the Mpika Power Supply Improvement Project. According to this agreement, ICBC was to disburse funds directly to TBEA Company Ltd., which would in turn use the loan proceeds to finance the implementation of the project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 335 basis points.   As of December 31, 2017, the loan's amount outstanding was $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, the loan's amount outstanding was $27.71 million.   The project sought to improve the supply of power in Mpika district within Muchinga Province by improving its (330-66 KV) electricity substation.  TBEA Company Ltd. was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in 2017 and the project had achieved an 85% completion rate (and 40% loan disbursement rate) by December 2018. The project was ultimately completed on March 15, 2019.  1. This project is also known as the Improvement of Power in Mpika District Project and the Mpika Power Supply, 330-66 KV Substation Project. The Chinese project title is 赞比亚Mpika地区电力改善项目. 2. The SAIS-CARI Chinese Loans to Africa database released in July 2020 identifies this loan as having an 18-year maturity length. However, AidData relies on ZESCO sources (source ID#67341 and #88869), which identify a 15-year maturity. 3. The all-in interest-rate was calculated as follows: 0.999% (Average 6-month USD LIBOR from July 2016) + 3.35% (335 basis points) = 4.349%. 4. Even though Zambian official sources (ID#67341, #88869) portrayed this is as just an ordinary ICBC loan, TBEA (source ID#117086) confirmed that ICBC provided a seller's credit. 5. The monetary value of the EPC contract with TBEA was $38 million.6. Official sources differ on the precise face value and commitment date of the loan. The Government of Zambia's Loans and Guarantees (Authorisation) (Exemption) Notice of 2017 identifies a $19.6 million ICBC loan that was issued on July 13, 2017 for the Mpika Power Supply Improvement Project (https://www.zambialaws.com/Zambia2017Pdfsi/SI%2049%20of%202017.pdf).

The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB. Then, on January 28, 2016, AGTF signed a $50 million loan agreement (ID#5050130000051) with the Government of Zambia for the Chinsali-Nakonde Road Rehabilitation Project. On the same day, the African Development Bank’s African Development Fund (ADF) issued a $193 million loan agreement (ID#2000130013830) to the Government of Zambia for the same project.  The borrowing terms of the AGTF, which entered into force on October 4, 2016, is as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 0.6% margin, no commitment fee, and no management fee. The first AfDB, ADF, and AGTF loan disbursements took place on August 16, 2016. As of December 2020, the AGTF loan had achieved an 8% disbursement rate ($4.43 million out of $50 million). As of June 2021, the AGTF loan had achieved a 23% completion rate ($11,500,000 our to $50 million). The aggregate amount outstanding under the AGTF loan for the Integrated Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Program (captured via Project ID#92095) and the AGTF loan for the Chinsali-Nakonde Road Rehabilitation Project (captured via Project ID#87029) was $16,954,890 as of June 30, 2021, $39,179,790 as of June 30, 2022, and $40,559,709 as of December 31, 2022.   The purpose of the project is the rehabilitation of the Chinsali – Nakonde road (210 km) in two lots: Lot 1: Chinsali – Isoka (100 km) and Lot 2: Isoka – Nakonde (110 km). These two lots are to be implemented concurrently over a period of 40 months with due cognisance taken of the rain patterns in the region. The project also includes consultancy services for the supervision of the civil works, and technical audits to foster quality and enhance sustainability. The Chinsali – Nakonde Road Section forms a part of the Zambian Great North Road (T2) that is a section of international routes: the Trans-Africa Highway and the North-South Corridor (NSC). The NSC is a joint COMESA/EAC/SADC Aid for Trade initiative, the primary aim of which is to reduce the transport costs along this priority Corridor which links the port of Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania to the Copper-belt (Southern DRC and Northern Zambia) and connects to the southern ports of South Africa (Durban). The Corridor system, with its spurs, services eight countries in the region- Tanzania, DR Congo, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and South Africa.    The contractor for Lot 1 is China State Construction Engineering Corporation while for Lot 2 the contractor is China Railway Seventh Group Company Limited. Lot 1 commenced on April 15, 2019.  Lot 2 commenced on April 23, 2019. Roughly on year later, in June 2020, Lot 1 had achieved a 13.56% completion rate and Lot 2 had achieved a 13.08% completion rate.  As of June 2021, the project  still  had  a  low  loan disbursement  rate  (30%  on the ADB loan  and 23%  on the AGTF loan). The main reason for the low loan disbursement rate was the lower than originally expected cost of the civil works contracts, resulting in a commitment rate of 67% and thus a large  uncommitted  balance  on  the  loans.  Secondly,  the civil works contracts commenced later than expected due to delays in procurement. COVID-19 also disrupted progress for 10 months. Despite this constraint, civil works  had achieved a 48%  completion rate as of June 2021.  Consulting services and institutional capacity building were also ‘progressing well’ as of June 2021. Counterpart financing for project-affected persons (PAPs), although  largely covered (70%), slowed down due to Government of Zambia’s difficulty in financing its budget. However, as a mitigating measure, the African Development Bank approved 100% financing of civil works and Government  of Zambia agreed to  concentrate  on  resettlement  and  compensation of PAPs. The project’s originally expected completion date is June 30, 2023. 1. The AfDB project identification number is P-ZM-DB0-003.  2.

The main  program  outcomes  include  (i)  increase  in  proportion  of  residents  accessing  improved water  supply  and  sanitation,  (ii)  increased  hours  of  water  supply,  (iii)  increased  revenue  collection efficiency  and  (iv)  reduction  in Non-Revenue  Water  (NRW). At  the output  level, activities  encompass rehabilitation  and  expansion  of climate  resilient water and  sewerage infrastructure, training of  utility staff  (>50% of female staff), training of national/municipal staff, training of women and youth in artisan skills and training of women to operate and maintain water kiosks. The program was originally expected to be implemented over 48 months beginning in January 2017 at a cost of $150.57 million. At completion in 2020, the program was expected to benefit 639,927 people directly and an additional 287,212 beneficiaries  indirectly,  who live around  the  targeted  towns.  Residents  were expected to  gain  better  health  from increased access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, and women and school going children were expected to  benefit  particularly  from  utilization  of  time  earlier  spent  on  collecting  water  for  income  generating activities as well as improved school enrollment and retention of girls. There were also expected benefits from employment/livelihood opportunities generated by the program, training of artisans (30% women) and empowerment of women and youth groups for possible business along the water and sanitation value chain and catchment management. China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation.    A groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 22, 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the pace of program implementation. All of the major works contracts were disrupted. The pandemic slowed down procurement of key materials as well as availability of key staff. Works on project sites slowed as public health regulations had to be adhered to in keeping with having less numbers of workers due to social distancing rules. The Government of Zambia had challenges in providing its counterpart contribution to provide compensation of project-affected person and resettlement.

ICBC subsequently issued a buyer’s credit (loan) to PSPF and authorized it to used the proceeds of the loan to partially finance the August 24, 2016 commercial contract. The Government of Zambia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The loan’s principal amount outstanding was $52,726,058 as of December 31, 2020, $52,726,058 as of June 30, 2021, $52,726,058 as of June 30, 2022, and $41,263,871 as of December 31, 2022.    The purpose of the project was to construct a large shopping mall, entertainment center, office building, four-star hotel, parking lot, overpass, and related ancillary facilities on Alick Nkhata Road in the Longacres suburb of Lusaka.   China State Construction Engineering Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. It took possession of the project site on September 15, 2016. Construction began in May 2017 and the Longacres Mall was officially commissioned on December 24, 2022. However, there are indications that this project underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the project owner (PSPF). The project’s originally scheduled completion date was March 15, 2019. However, on May 7, 2019, the commercial contract between PSPF and China State Construction Engineering Corporation was modified such that the contract price was increased to $107,136,292.69 and the expected project completion date was pushed out until July 31, 2021.   There are also questions about the financial health of the borrowing institution. Section 29 (2) of the Public Service Pensions Act No 35 of 1996 stipulates that the PSPF Board shall not invest assets in excess of twenty percent (20%) of its net asset value in any one form of investment. However, the investment in the Longacres Mall Construction Project was expected to cost $107,136,293 (K2,249,862,153), thus exceeding the 20% threshold as the net assets were valued at K918,639,295 as of December 31, 2019. 1.

The facility has a term (maturity) of 15 years, which includes an initial grace period of five years during which the Government Angola is not required to make principal repayments. The Government of Angola did not issue a sovereign guarantee for the loan, but it is insured by China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure).  The (principal) amount outstanding under the facility was $326.2 million as of December 31, 2017 and $332 million as of December 31, 2021. The availability period applicable to the facility ended in June 2020. The proceeds of the loan were to be used to finance up to 85% of the price of an $985,260,295 commercial contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC).  The project involved the construction of a 750MW combined cycle power plant in the town of Soyo in Zaire Province. Construction began on December 31, 2015, and a project completion ceremony was held on August 18, 2017.  The plant began delivering power to the grid ahead of schedule on May 19, 2019.

65748,"CDB provides $2.174 billion -- via oil-backed loan facility -- for water and energy sector projects (Linked to Project ID#66847, #95415) On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017.    As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The proceeds of the loan facility were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.   Chinese firms are reportedly responsible for carrying out most of the work tied to the subsidiary loans under the oil prepayment facility; however, the December 9, 2015 agreement specifies that at least 20% of the work would need to be subcontracted to Angolan firms and that local materials should be used whenever possible.  The following is a list of projects financed through the $15 oil prepayment facility agreement. The transaction (financial commitment) amounts for these projects are unknown and therefore not recorded: Project ID#66852: rehabilitation of a provincial hospital in Cabinda Project ID#66868: restoration and expansion of political administrative building in Cabinda Project ID#66869:  restoration and expansion of Cabinda University campus in Cabinda Project ID#73904: Soyo River and Land Terminal Construction Project Project ID#73546: Camucuio Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73547: Bibala Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73550: Cuemba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73551: Tchicala-Tcholoanga Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73552: Bula Atumba Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73554: Phase 2 of the Malanje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73555: Marimba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73556: Massango Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73560: M’Banza Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73561: Quela Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73562: Muxima Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73563: Cangandala Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73564: Jamba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73565: Cacula Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73566: Kiwaba Nzoje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73567: Lucapa Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73572: 15 km Cuito Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73630: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 2) and Ponte do Rio Longa-Ponte do Rio Keve Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73631: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 5) and Ponte do Rio Eval-Ponte do Rio Culango Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73914: Caconda-Chicomba-Quipungo Section (Lot 1) and Rio Ngalo-Caconda Section of EN110/EN280 Road Rehabilitation Project  The following projects were potentially funded through the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement: Project ID#68976: Supply of Equipment to Medical and Physical Rehabilitation Center in Huambo Project ID#68977: Supply of equipment to Municipal Hospital of Cunene Project ID#73905: 3000 Sambizanga Social Housing Units Project Project ID#73906: 12 km Sambizanga-Luanda Road Reconstruction Project Project ID#73460: Sumbe City Integrated Infrastructure Construction Project (Lots 1-3) Project ID#73684: 400 KM Laúca-Huambo Power Transmission Line Project Project ID#73559: Zango V Water Supply Project  Project ID#53063 records the $10 billion recapitalization of Sonangol and prepayment of outstanding debts to the CDB. [Note: In 2016, CDB approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol (Angola’s state-owned oil company) and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used  $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (see Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47103). However, according to the IMF, a $6.9 billion loan on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of the loan was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing.  $5 billion of the proceeds from the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement were reportedly to be used to finance public investment projects in Angola, including work on a dam in Kwanza Norte; several new roads and industrial hubs; the construction and rehabilitation of hospitals, medical centers, schools, universities, teaching training colleges; work on Cabinda's airport; domestic water and electricity connections; and irrigation projects. The credit line, often referred to as the China Credit Line (CCL), was reportedly meant to finance 155 public investment projects carried out by 37 Chinese companies.  The nine sectors that were to be covered by the CCL’s operational plan include 34 energy and water projects ($2.174 billion), 33 construction (including road repair) projects ($1.644 billion), and 55 education projects ($373 million). The province of Luanda, with 18 projects, was expected to receive about one-fifth of the total financing. The province of Huambo province was expected to receive $776 million for 12 projects.

In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023. 1. The transaction (financial commitment) amount is recorded as $2.174 billion. It excludes the transaction amounts for individual water and energy projects captured by AidData, which sum to $1.753 billion. 2. This transaction is not recorded as an umbrella record as it does not duplicate any other transactions captured by AidData, and should therefore be counted towards the total amount drawn down under the $15 billion oil-backed loan facility agreement.3. Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (i) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (ii) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited.  There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 4. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015.

In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023. 1. The transaction (financial commitment) amount is recorded as $1.644 billion. It excludes the transaction amounts for construction sector projects captured elsewhere by AidData, which sum to $708.9 million. 2. This transaction is not recorded as an umbrella record as it does not duplicate any other transactions captured by AidData, and should be counted towards the total amount drawn down under the $15 billion oil-backed loan facility agreement.3. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015.

Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (i) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (ii) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.",True,0.7869629
66847,"CDB provides $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement for public investment projects, prepayment of debts, and recapitalization of Sonangol (Linked to Project ID#53063) On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017. As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).  The proceeds of the loan were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.    Chinese firms are reportedly responsible for carrying out most of the work tied to the subsidiary loans under the oil prepayment facility; however, the December 9, 2015 agreement specifies that at least 20% of the work would need to be subcontracted to Angolan firms and that local materials should be used whenever possible.  The following is a list of projects financed through the $15 oil prepayment facility agreement. The transaction (financial commitment) amounts for these projects are unknown and therefore not recorded: Project ID#66852: rehabilitation of a provincial hospital in Cabinda Project ID#66868: restoration and expansion of political administrative building in Cabinda Project ID#66869:  restoration and expansion of Cabinda University campus in Cabinda Project ID#73904: Soyo River and Land Terminal Construction Project Project ID#73546: Camucuio Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73547: Bibala Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73550: Cuemba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73551: Tchicala-Tcholoanga Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73552: Bula Atumba Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73554: Phase 2 of the Malanje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73555: Marimba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73556: Massango Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73560: M’Banza Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73561: Quela Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73562: Muxima Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73563: Cangandala Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73564: Jamba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73565: Cacula Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73566: Kiwaba Nzoje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73567: Lucapa Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73572: 15 km Cuito Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73630: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 2) and Ponte do Rio Longa-Ponte do Rio Keve Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73631: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 5) and Ponte do Rio Eval-Ponte do Rio Culango Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73914: Caconda-Chicomba-Quipungo Section (Lot 1) and Rio Ngalo-Caconda Section of EN110/EN280 Road Rehabilitation Project  The following projects were potentially funded through the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement: Project ID#68976: Supply of Equipment to Medical and Physical Rehabilitation Center in Huambo Project ID#68977: Supply of equipment to Municipal Hospital of Cunene Project ID#73905: 3000 Sambizanga Social Housing Units Project Project ID#73906: 12 km Sambizanga-Luanda Road Reconstruction Project Project ID#73460: Sumbe City Integrated Infrastructure Construction Project (Lots 1-3) Project ID#73684: 400 KM Laúca-Huambo Power Transmission Line Project Project ID#73559: Zango V Water Supply Project  Project ID#53063 records the $10 billion recapitalization of Sonangol and prepayment of outstanding debts to the CDB. [Note: In 2016, CDB approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol (Angola’s state-owned oil company) and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used  $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (see Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47103). However, according to the IMF, a $6.9 billion loan on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of the loan was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing.  $5 billion of the proceeds from the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement were reportedly to be used to finance public investment projects in Angola, including work on a dam in Kwanza Norte; several new roads and industrial hubs; the construction and rehabilitation of hospitals, medical centers, schools, universities, teaching training colleges; work on Cabinda's airport; domestic water and electricity connections; and irrigation projects. The credit line, often referred to as the China Credit Line (CCL), was reportedly meant to finance 155 public investment projects carried out by 37 Chinese companies.  The nine sectors that were to be covered by the CCL’s operational plan include 34 energy and water projects ($2.174 billion), 33 construction (including road repair) projects ($1.644 billion), and 55 education projects ($373 million).

In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023. 1. This transaction is not recorded as an umbrella record as it does not duplicate any other transactions captured by AidData, and should be counted towards the total amount drawn down under the $15 billion oil-backed loan facility agreement.2. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015.

Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (i) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (ii) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.",True,0.709435
73432,"CDB provides $1 billion -- via oil-backed loan facility -- to finance 18 projects in Luanda Province (Linked to Project ID#66847, #95415) On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017.    As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The proceeds of the loan facility were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.   Chinese firms are reportedly responsible for carrying out most of the work tied to the subsidiary loans under the oil prepayment facility; however, the December 9, 2015 agreement specifies that at least 20% of the work would need to be subcontracted to Angolan firms and that local materials should be used whenever possible.  The following is a list of projects financed through the $15 oil prepayment facility agreement. The transaction (financial commitment) amounts for these projects are unknown and therefore not recorded: Project ID#66852: rehabilitation of a provincial hospital in Cabinda Project ID#66868: restoration and expansion of political administrative building in Cabinda Project ID#66869:  restoration and expansion of Cabinda University campus in Cabinda Project ID#73904: Soyo River and Land Terminal Construction Project Project ID#73546: Camucuio Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73547: Bibala Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73550: Cuemba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73551: Tchicala-Tcholoanga Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73552: Bula Atumba Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73554: Phase 2 of the Malanje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73555: Marimba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73556: Massango Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73560: M’Banza Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73561: Quela Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73562: Muxima Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73563: Cangandala Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73564: Jamba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73565: Cacula Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73566: Kiwaba Nzoje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73567: Lucapa Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73572: 15 km Cuito Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73630: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 2) and Ponte do Rio Longa-Ponte do Rio Keve Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73631: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 5) and Ponte do Rio Eval-Ponte do Rio Culango Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73914: Caconda-Chicomba-Quipungo Section (Lot 1) and Rio Ngalo-Caconda Section of EN110/EN280 Road Rehabilitation Project  The following projects were potentially funded through the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement: Project ID#68976: Supply of Equipment to Medical and Physical Rehabilitation Center in Huambo Project ID#68977: Supply of equipment to Municipal Hospital of Cunene Project ID#73905: 3000 Sambizanga Social Housing Units Project Project ID#73906: 12 km Sambizanga-Luanda Road Reconstruction Project Project ID#73460: Sumbe City Integrated Infrastructure Construction Project (Lots 1-3) Project ID#73684: 400 KM Laúca-Huambo Power Transmission Line Project Project ID#73559: Zango V Water Supply Project  Project ID#53063 records the $10 billion recapitalization of Sonangol and prepayment of outstanding debts to the CDB. [Note: In 2016, CDB approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol (Angola’s state-owned oil company) and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used  $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (see Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47103). However, according to the IMF, a $6.9 billion loan on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of the loan was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing.  $5 billion of the proceeds from the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement were reportedly to be used to finance public investment projects in Angola, including work on a dam in Kwanza Norte; several new roads and industrial hubs; the construction and rehabilitation of hospitals, medical centers, schools, universities, teaching training colleges; work on Cabinda's airport; domestic water and electricity connections; and irrigation projects. The credit line, often referred to as the China Credit Line (CCL), was reportedly meant to finance 155 public investment projects carried out by 37 Chinese companies.

In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023. 1. The transaction (financial commitment) amount is recorded as $776 million. It excludes the transaction amounts for projects in Huambo Province captured elsewhere by AidData, which sum to $728.7 million. 2. This transaction is not recorded as an umbrella record as it does not duplicate any other transactions captured by AidData, and should therefore be counted towards the total amount drawn down under the $15 billion oil-backed loan facility agreement.3. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015.

Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (i) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (ii) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.",True,0.75531304

The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.  Then, on July 12, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Benin signed an RMB 400 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Adjarala Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.  The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.

The proceeds from these three loans are to be used by the borrowers to finance a FCFA 265,814,526,897 commercial contract between la Communauté Electrique du Bénin (CEB) and Sinohydro, which was signed on April 25, 2014.  This project involves the construction of a dam in Adjarala, which is located approximately 100 km downstream of the 65MW Nangbéto hydropower plant on the Mono River.  The dam will stand 40 meters tall, with a 3.7 long kilometer reservoir.  The project also involves the construction of 252 kilometers of 161 KV high voltage power transmission lines, water diversion systems, plants, access roads and other ancillary facilities.  The ultimate objective of the project is to strengthen regional energy interconnection and alleviate electric power shortages in Benin and Togo.  Sinohydro is the contractor responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 26, 2015.  Then, in December 2016, the project was suspended after the Togolese Minister of Economy and Finance announced that there were insufficient financial resources to complete the project.  The project resumed in January 2017, and as of September 2017 it was still under construction. It is expected to reach completion by 2020. 1.

The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial contract between Benin Telecom S.A. and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed on August 5, 2014.   The purpose of the project was to expand access to high-speed internet, a fiber optic cable, and 4G technology by rehabilitating a 1060 km fiber optic backbone network that runs from Cotonou to Malanville, constructing a 222 km metropolitan fiber optic loop in Cotonou and surrounding areas, and deploying a 974 km high speed fiber optic broadband network with IMS/MPLS core. The project had six components: 1. Reinforcement of 2000 km of fiber optic cable called the ‘National Backbone’. 2. Building a metro network in Cotonou, comprised of almost 24 km of fiber optic cable. 3. Building a FTTx access network by modernizing sub-distributors of 125 Multi-Service Access Nodes (MSAN). 4. Modernizing a 230 km fiber optic cable line. 5. Creating 30 new 4G base stations. 6. Creating another IP Multimedia Subsystem core network. This project also involved the installation of 48 IP/MPLS routers to extend the IP BTS network. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony for the project’s first phase was held on November 26, 2015. However, Phase 1 implementation did not commence until December 2016. By March 31, 2018, the project’s first phase had achieved an 83% completion rate, with 67 of Benin’s 77 communes (municipalities) currently connected to the fiber-optic backbone. The project’s first phase was originally scheduled for completion in June 2018 but it ultimately reached completion in June 2018. Then, on September 14, 2021, the Government of Benin and China Eximbank signed an RMB 265 million government concessional loan agreement for Phase 2 of the National Broadband Network Project.

Then, on January 22, 2015, China Eximbank and the Cameroon Ministry of Planning, Economy and Regional Development (MINEPAT) signed an RMB 513 million (CFA 43 billion) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 28 TOTAL NO. (531)] for Phase 3 of the Cameroon Fiber Optic Transmission Backbone Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.   MINEPAT then on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Cameroon’s state-owned telecoms operator, CamTel, which in turn used the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd (that was signed on January 17, 2013 and amended on December 17, 2013).  As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 41.7 billion. Its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 42 billion as of December 31, 2016, CFA 41 billion as of December 31, 2017, CFA 43 billion as of December 31, 2018, and CFA 43 billion as of December 31, 2019.  Phase 3 involved laying 3,950 kilometers of fiber optic cable in Cameroon. The Cameroon Fiber Optic Transmission Backbone Project was implemented in 3 phases. The first phase (captured via Project#201) started in 2009 and ended in 2011.  The second phase, which involved laying of 3,200 kilometers of fiber optic cable in the northern part of Cameroon (Maroua), started in 2011 and ended in 2013.  The third phase (captured via Project ID#36246) began in February 2015 and was completed in 2017. As of 2017, about 12,000 kilometers of fiber cables had been laid across Cameroon, but the project was still in progress as the government wants at least 20,000 kilometers of fiber cables around Cameroon (FOSMN).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Cameroon Backbone Expansion Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding.

The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.358% in January 2015) plus a 4% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% commitment fee, and a 0.30% management fee. The borrower was also required to purchase buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. The proceeds of the BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a commercial contract ($798,000,000) between Cameroon's Ministry of Water Resources and Energy and China National Machinery Industry Corporation (Sinomach), which was signed on October 28, 2014. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 49.4% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 184.1 billion) and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 179.7 billion.   The purpose of the project is to supply potable water to Yaoundé, Batchenga, Obala, Nkometou, Soa and Ntui from the Sanaga River via the construction of a 62 km pipeline. According to Annex A of the loan agreement, the ""main objective of the project is as follows: the construction of a water station on the river Sanaga at the place called Nachtigal; the construction of a potable water treatment plant with a nominal capacity of [300,000] cubic meters/day; the installation of raw water supply pipes and treated water with a diameter of 1800 mm ductile pig iron on a total distance of about 62 km including their protecting equipments and piping system accessories; the construction of two water absorption stations at Nkometou II and at Nyom II; the construction of a storage tank of 6,000 cubic meters in Yaoundé on Mount Ndindan and connecting pipes to existing reservoirs in the Yaoundé city; the construction of a high voltage electric line from Oyom Abang to Nkometou II; the construction of average voltage lines from Nkometou II towards Nyom II, Batchenga and Nachtigal; the supply of 18 vehicles for works and management of installations (one truck with lifting crane, two Toyota Coasters, two Toyoto Land Cruiser, two Toyota Pick up Hilux, three Toyota Prado, five Toyota Berline Corolla); the installation of a remote management system of facilities built within the project framework; the construction and installation of any related infrastructure and equipment; the supply of spare parts. Upon completion, the project is expected to produce 300,000 m3 (cubic meters) of water per day, expandable to 400,000 m3 (cubic meters) per day, and its implementation is expected solve the problem of insufficient potable water supply in Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.   Construction began in December 2014 and was expected to reach completion by December 2017. However, as of September 2018, the project had only achieved a 30% completion rate. The first batch of equipment that was acquired with the proceeds of the loan -- in particular, the water pipes -- was received in October 2017 and forwarded to the project's storage sites in Nkometou. As of October 2020, the project had only achieved a 68% completion rate due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Work was also delayed due to the late release of rights of way and the non-payment of Sinomach’s invoices for several months. Project implementation was accelerated between October 2020 and October 2021; in particular, there was a significant increase in the laying of pipes from 800 meters in 2020 to 27 kilometers in 2021. These and other actions undertaken through October 2021 brought the overall completion (physical execution) rate of the project to 81.5%. As of October 2021, the Nachtigal raw water collection and pumping station had achieved a 97% completion rate; the water treatment plant at Emana Batchenga had achieved a 98.5% completion rate; the 90kV/30kV transformer substation at Nkometou had achieved a 97.6% completion rate; the treated water pumping station at Nkometou had achieved a 96.1% completion rate; the treated water pumping station at Nyom had achieved a 61% completion rate; the Ndindan treated water tank had achieved a 5.2% completion rate; and the project component focused on the laying of pipes from Nachtigal to Yaounde had achieved a 36% completion rate.

The Bank of China loan for Phase 1 carried a 13 year maturity, 4 year grace period, and 4.2% interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, the loan for Phase 1 had achieved a 91.4% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 4.2 billion) and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 31.4 billion.   The Bank of China loan for Phase 2 carried a 12 year maturity, 3 year grace period, and 5% interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, the loan for Phase 2 had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 59.5 billion. Project ID#53117 captures the supplier credit that Huawei offered to the Government of Cameroon in 2015.   Project ID#57697 captures the buyer’s credit loan from Bank of China for Phase 1 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project. Project ID#53234 captures the loan from Bank of China for Phase 2 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project.   The purpose of the Solar Rural Electrification Project was to supply, install and operate photovoltaic infrastructure (known as solar mini-grids or solar micro-grids) in 350 localities (villages and towns) in Cameroon. The project, which was implemented in two phases, sought to cover 58 states within 10 major regions across the country and deliver 70MW of solar energy to 150,000 people across 1,000 sites and 350 localities. Phase 1 targeted 166 localities and Phase 2 targeted 184 localities. It was originally envisaged that villagers would pay less than FCFA 100 for a kilowatt of power once the project was fully operational.   Huawei was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both phases of the project. Phase 1 officially commenced on November 29, 2016. Huawei reportedly installed a number of solar-backed micro-grid systems across the country in 2017, with systems ranging from 30 kW to 300 kW in size, featuring advanced maximum power point tracker (MPPT) technology, high-efficiency inverters, and advanced charging-discharging management. Phase 1 ultimately delivered 11.2MW of solar energy to 166 localities (villages and towns) and it reportedly benefited between 13,984 and 22,240 households (including 3,100 households that secured electricity connections in 2021). These localities received electricity from a solar power plant in the village of Nsem, which was officially commissioned in November 24, 2018. However, the first phase of the project was plagued by accusations of corruption and embezzlement. As of late 2021, Phase 1 was not yet complete. However, the management of all photovoltaic infrastructure that was installed during Phase 1 was handed over to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency in February 2021.   Phase 2 commenced in 2018, and as of December 14, 2018, it had achieved a 31% completion rate. As of late 2021, all Phase 2 construction activities were complete and 9,820 household electricity connections had been established (including 3,946 in 2021), but the Phase 2 campaign to increase the number of households with electricity connections was still underway and efforts to transfer management of all photovoltaic infrastructure installed during Phase 2 to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency were ongoing. In November 2020, the Government of Cameroon announced plans to pursue a third phase of the project, which would seek to reach an additional 200 localities (villages and towns).  There are some indications that the Bank of China loans for the first and second phases of the Solar Rural Electrification Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’  1.

The Government of Ethiopia issued a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: an 8-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.95% margin. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost of a $647 million commercial contract between Jianglian Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and the ESC, which was signed on August 13, 2013.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $550 million loan achieved an 88% disbursement rate, with ICBC making 9 loan disbursements (worth ETB 9,961,853,894) between 2016 and 2018: an ETB 2,448,261,038 disbursement on May 31, 2016, an ETB 298,977,218 disbursement on April 30, 2017, an ETB 692,625,989 disbursement on September 18, 2018, an ETB 75,043,474 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 27,682,313 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 34,611,272 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 778,810,201 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 280,385,250 disbursement on November 23, 2018, and an ETB 5,325,457,140 disbursement on November 23, 2018.   The Omo Kuraz Sugar Project consists of five sugar plants (Omo Kuraz 1, Omo Kuraz 2, Omo Kuraz 3, Omo Kuraz 4, and Omo Kuraz 5). The Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project involves the construction of the fifth factory in the Omo-Kuraz Sugar Project. This factory is located in Awi Zone’s Jawi District of Amhara region. Upon completion, the facility is expected to produce 242,000 tons of sugar and 20 million 827 liters ethanol a year at full capacity. As part of the project, extensive irrigation infrastructure is also being constructed on Omo River in order to enable 100,000 hectares of land to be covered with sugarcane.  Jiangxi Jianglian International Engineering Co. Ltd (JJIEC), a subsidiary of Jianglian Heavy Industry, is the contractor responsible for project implementation. According to the ESC, the project is being undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 construction activities commenced in November 2016. To date, 30,000 hectares of land at the project site have been irrigated, of which 16,0000 hectares are covered with sugarcane.   However, this project has also become a source of scandal and controversy. On July 25, 2017, Yuan Jialin, the JJIEC head of the Omo Kuraz 5 Project, was detained in relation to an alleged act of corruption: paying a $30 million bribe (‘commission’) for Ethiopian Ministry of Finance officials to illegally grant a contract to JJIEC. Yuan Jialin, wrote a letter to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on May 29, 2018, requesting his personal intervention. In his letter, he indicated that he had been denied bail for nearly a year. He also wrote that “JJIEC […] operates on the highest standard and uses fair and competitive system of procurement and carefully controls projects at hand to be free from corruptive and fraudulent activities."" Jialin also argued in the letter that it was difficult to commit corruption in a strictly monitored purchase process. He claimed that there has not been any evidence to substantiate the charges brought against him. He also noted that, while JJIEC recruited a lawyer to investigate the alleged corruption, he was subjected to an inappropriate search which resulted in physical and psychological damages to him. He also asserted that the documentary evidence presented to substantiate the charges against him were counterfeit. He also warned that the ‘dire situation’ of the Omo Kuraz 5 project might hamper the bilateral relations between the Ethiopian Government and JJIEC, and requested that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed establish a neutral and separate body to see his case and give him a speedy trial.  There are indications that the ICBC loan for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country.' Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

As part of its financing proposal to the Government of Ghana, StarTimes DTV Ghana Company Ltd. submitted a letter of intent from China Development Bank. However, StarTimes DTV Ghana Company Ltd. later proposed a concessional loan facility with China Eximbank.   In 2012, China Eximbank agreed in principle to finance Ghana Digital Migration Project (DTT). The purpose of this project would be to help Ghana migrate from an analogue to digital terrestrial platform. StarTimes Ghana later assigned its interest to StarTimes China because it was a necessary condition for funding from the China Eximbank, and after six months of delays, the contract was assigned to StarTimes China on September 27, 2012. Then, on April 16, 2015, China Eximbank signed a $95 million concessional loan agreement with Ghana’s Ministry of Communication for the Ghana Digital Migration Project (DTT). This loan carried the following terms: an interest rate of 2 percent, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 15 years.   However, due to allegedly fraudulent behavior by StarTimes China, the Government of Ghana sought to cancel its commercial contract with the company. StarTimes China then filed a writ in Ghana against the decision and applied for an injunction to restrain the Ministry of Communications from inviting new tenders for the DTT Project. On March 9, 2015, the Commercial Division of Ghana’s High Court dismissed the interlocutory injunction and awarded cost a $50,000 judgment against StarTimes. Startimes China then commenced arbitration proceedings against Ghana’s Ministry of Communications at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Court of Arbitration in London. The ICC upheld the rights of Ghana’s Ministry of Communications to terminate its contract with StarTimes China on February 22, 2017, and ruled that StarTimes China could only be entitled to compensation based on work done.   After the contract was terminated, another competitive tender was instituted in which StarTimes China refused to participate. KNET, a Ghanaian company won the bid, and in 2016 it completed more than half of the DTT Project. China Eximbank cancelled the loan facility for the DTT Project on May 11, 2018. ",False,0.11116617
91941,"China Eximbank provides USD $78 million loan for Conakry Electricity Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project (Linked to Project ID#53003) On January 4, 2013, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a USD $334.65 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 49 TOTAL NO. (437)] with the Government of Guinea for the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#53003, carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. The Government of Guinea used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Société De Gestion de Kaléta (SOGEKA or 凯乐塔电站管理公司).  The borrower (SOGEKA) was to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 75% of the cost of a $446 million commercial (EPC) contract between China International Water & Electric Corporation and the Government of Guinea, which was signed on August 15, 2011. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, SOGEKA’s outstanding repayment obligations under the China Eximbank PBC agreement amounted to $404.14 million. SOGEKA also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned power utility, Electricité de Guinée (EDG), and agreed that once the Kaléta dam was operational, it would use the proceeds from the sale of electricity (generated by the dam) in order to facilitate the repayment of the China Eximbank loan. When SOGEKA was first established, the Government of Guinea held a 51% equity stake and China International Water & Electric Corporation held a 49% equity stake. However, on November 2, 2016, China Three Gorges Corporation purchased the Government of Guinea’s 51% equity stake for $200 million. The Government of Guinea used the $200 million to meet the requirement in a separate China Eximbank preferential buyer’s credit agreement (captured via Project ID#187) that covers 15% of the total cost ($1.383 billion) of the 450MW Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project.  The Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project involved the construction of a 240 MW dam that is located 110 km north of Conakry on the Konkouré River. The facility includes a roller-compacted concrete dam 72 feet in height by 5,069 feet in length. The dam impounds a reservoir that has 23 million cubic feet of storage capacity and the facility’s powerhouse has three 80-MW vertical axis Francis turbines. China International Water & Electric Corporation — a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation — was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on April 18, 2012. Kaléta dam began to fill water in April 2015. The turbines began to run and distribute electricity ahead of schedule on May 29, 2015. The power plant was constructed according to Chinese technical specifications, and 90% of its electromechanical equipment came from China. The dam was officially put into use on September 29, 2015. Then, an official project completion ceremony took place on October 10, 2015. As of January 31, 2019, the Kaléta hydroelectric power plant had generated 2.708 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. It reportedly doubled Guinea's electricity supply. Electricity subsidies from the Government of Guinea increased to 0.8% of GDP during the first half of 2019 when the country’s state-owned electricity company, the Public Utility Company (EDG), started to pay for the electricity generated by the Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant in January 2019.  On January 22, 2015, the Government of Guinea also authorized the ratification of a USD $78,064,538.90 loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Conakry Electricity Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project. The borrowing terms of this loan, which are captured via Project ID#91941, are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance an amended and expanded version of the commercial (EPC) contract that China International Water & Electric Corporation and the Government of Guinea signed on August 15, 2011. The purpose of this project was to evacuate power from the Kaléta hydroelectric power plant by constructing and rehabilitating 42 km of transmission lines and several substations, including (1) a 110 kV double circuit transmission line between Matoto substation and Manéah (Maneah) substation; (2) a 225 kV transmission line between Kaléta substation and Manéah substation; and (3) Tombo substation. The project also involved the acquisition and installation of electronic metering devices. CWE was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, Guangxi Transmission & Substation Construction Company was also involved as a subcontractor. The commissioning of all substations and transmission lines was completed on July 29, 2015. The project’s one-year warranty period officially began on August 31, 2015. A project performance certificate was issued on September 9, 2016. 1. This project is also known as the Urban Network Transformation Project. The French project title is LE PROJET DES TRAVAUX DE CONCEPTION, CONSTRUCTION, REHABILITATION ET MODERNISATION DU RESEAU ELECTRIQUE DE CONAKRY ET DE FOURNITURE DES COMPTEURS A PREPAIEMENT or La réhabilitation du réseau de transport d'électricité de la ville de Conakry. The Chinese project title is 几内亚城网改造项目 or 城网改造项目 or 几内亚科纳克里城网改造项目 or 科纳克里城网改造项目 or 凯乐塔输出工程及城网改造项目). 2. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020. Nor is it included in the the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020. 3. AidData relies on the face value of the loan that is recorded in the World Bank’s Debt Reporting System (DRS). 4. For the time being, AidData assumes that the same borrowing terms (20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 0.3% management fee) that applied to the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project applied to the Conakry Electricity Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project (since the proceeds from these two loans supported the same commercial contract with CWE). 5. A June 2021 publication from Guinea’s Ministry of Finance (https://www.dropbox.com/s/cix64qa1ubdpcwn/BULLETIN-STATISTIQUE-QUATRIEME-TRIMESTRE-2020-vf-1-juin-2021.pdf?dl=0) identifies the Government of Guinea’s total outstanding debt to China Eximbank for the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project as $404.14 million. This figure likely refers to the joint value of the debt incurred by the Government of Guinea for the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project and the Conakry Electricity Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project (since the proceeds from these two loans supported the same commercial contract with CWE).  $404.14 million is slight less than the sum of the $334.65 million China Eximbank loan that was issued in 2013 and the $78,064,538.90 loan that was issued in 2015 (which may be due to the netting out of reflows/repayments to the lender).6.

The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 10.25 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity. The loan is scheduled for repayment in semi-annual installments between December 31, 2025 and September 21, 2035.   The loan had achieved a disbursement rate of 93.47% ($126,922,733 out of $135,784,014) and there was an undrawn balance of $8,861,281 (worth 6.52% of the face value of the loan) as of June 30, 2021. The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 47,502,088.34 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and no principal repayments between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 818,856,345.01 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 866,358,433.35 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 866,358,433.35 as of June 30, 2022.  The purpose of the $151,047,789.51 project was to construct a solar power plant that is located 20 kilometers north of Garissa, in Barki Village. The power plant was originally planned to have a capacity of 50 MW, providing electricity for 350,000 people and 1000 employment opportunities for citizens in the area.   Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation (CJIC) was the general contractor responsible for project implementation, but it undertook the project in collaboration with Kenya's Rural Electrification Authority (REA) and the Chinese solar company JinkoSolar. Project implementation commenced on September 29, 2016. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta officially launched the power plant on December 13, 2019. When solar panel prices went down, the capacity of the plant was increased from 50MW to 54.66MW. Of the power produced by the plant, Garissa town consumes roughly 5MW and the rest is connected to the national grid, making it the biggest solar plant in East Africa. The plant sits on 85 acres and consists of 210,000 photovoltaic (PV) panels. The power plant is now operated by Kenya's Rural Electrification Authority (REA) and it sells power to Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC). 1. This project is also known as the Development of Solar Power Project in Garissa. The Chinese project title is 加里萨50MW光伏电站项目. 2. One source claims that the plant was commissioned as early as September 24, 2018. Another source also claims that the plant can service up to 625,000 homes. 3. The loan identification number in the National Treasury’s public debt register is 2015012 (or 2015012_1). 4. Given that this loan was issued as a GCL, it was almost certainly denominated in RMB. However, only the USD-equivalent value of the face value of the loan is known. This issue warrants further investigation. 5. The project coordinator is James Muriithi. 6. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it does not record the borrowing terms of this loan. AidData records the borrowing terms that are identified in the National Treasury’s external public debt register. 7. There are some grounds to question whether the first loan repayment date (and implied grace period) that is identified in the National Treasury’s external public debt register is correct. This issue warrants further investigation.8. The amounts outstanding and repayments data are drawn from the Kenyan Treasury’s External Public Debt Register.

47025,"China Eximbank provides $1.39 billion buyer’s credit loan for Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#37103, #31777) On December 3, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [Contract No. BLA201508] worth $1,397,927,373.27 for Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Nairobi-Naivasha Standard Gauge Railway Project). The BCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20.5 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.5% ($6,989,636.87) management fee, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 1% default interest rate. It is scheduled for 30 semi-annual repayments between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2036. The loan is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $161,875,409.70.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (BCL) to finance (a) 85% ($1,260,333,275.02) of the total cost of a $1,482,745,029.40 commercial contract between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on September 19, 2015; and (b) 85% of the total cost ($137,594,098.25 out of $161,875,409.70) of the medium-long term buyer’s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 15% ($222,411,754.41) of the $1,482,745,029.40 commercial contract cost was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing. The National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL to the project’s ‘end-user’ (Kenya Railways Corporation).   The loan is also secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues from the Railway Development Fund (RDF), which are deposited in an escrow account.  According to the audited financial statements of Kenya Railways Corporation, the cash balances in the escrow account (Account No. 1203286473) were as follows: KES 239,914,450 (USD 2,327,170.16) in June 2017, KES 241,215,828 (USD 2,388,036.69) in June 2018, KES 2,816,826,324 (USD 27,604,897.97) in June 2019, and KES 2,853,104,749 (USD 26,819,184.64) in June 2020.  According to the Government of Kenya’s External Public Debt Register, a loan disbursement of $126,033,327.50 took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021). The borrower made principal repayments worth $46,101,100.98 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was $1,256,999,701.81 as of June 30, 2020, $1,383,033,029.31 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,336,931,928.33 as of June 30, 2022.    The purpose of the railway extension project was to construct a 120 km railway — including a 5.3 kilometer tunnel to be built in Great Rift Valley and a 6.5 viaduct across Nairobi National Park — that would link special industrial zones in Naivasha (home to the Olkaria geothermal power plants) to Nairobi and Mombasa. The 120 km stretch of railway starts from the west end of the Nairobi South Hub (end point of the Mombasa – Nairobi SGR); then it turns south-westwards through the Nairobi National Park and west past Twala and Ongata Rongai Towns; then it crosses Magadi Road next to the Adventists University and Ngong Road at Embulbul; then it descends into Rift Valley through a tunnel located North-West of Ngong Hills; then it proceeds North-West to the proposed Industrial Parks at Mai Mahiu and Suswa; then it crosses B3 at Duka Moja.    China Communications Construction Company and China Bridge and Road Corporation (CRBC) were the contractors responsible for project implementation. This project was formally launched by the President of Kenya on October 19, 2016 (through a foundation stone-laying ceremony). Construction was originally expected to be complete by June 2019. Construction ultimately commenced on January 12, 2018 and reached completion on September 19, 2019. The railway line from Nairobi to Naivasha was opened to traffic on October 16, 2019. However, this project encountered local resistance and provoked significant controversy. In April 2018, China Eximbank reportedly decided to withhold loan disbursements worth KES 32 billion due to a barrage of court cases against the project. 1. This project is also known as the Development of Nairobi to Naivasha Standard Gauge Railway Project and the Nairobi-Malaba Railway Project. The Chinese project title is 肯尼亚内罗毕至马拉巴铁路项目. 2.

52499,"[Cancelled] ICBC provides $900 million export credit for 981.5 MW Lamu Coal-Fired Power Plant Project On June 8, 2015, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed an indicative term sheet for a $900 million export credit financing agreement with Amu Power Company Limited for the 981.5 MW Lamu Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. The ICBC loan was offered on the following terms: an 18-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, a 3 month LIBOR plus a 2% margin, a 1.1% arrangement (management) fee, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 2% default (penalty) interest rate.  The export credit financing agreement was reportedly finalized in 2015, but the official commitment date is unknown.  The borrower was responsible for purchasing buyer’s credit insurance rom Sinosure. The borrower also pledged a number of different sources of collateral, including all project revenues and assets and its insurance policy with Sinosure.  Kenya’s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (MoEP) requested Expressions of Interest for the 981.5 MW Lamu Coal-Fired Power Plant Project in 2013, invited tenders in early 2014, and awarded the project to Amu Power Company Limited in September 2014. Amu Power Company Limited is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that was created by its sponsors/shareholders for the purpose of financing, designing, constructing, owning, maintaining, and operating a 981.5 MW coal-fired power plant in Lamu County, Kenya, which will sell power to Kenya Power and Light Company (KPLC) under a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Amu Power Company Limited is 51% owned by Kenyan investment firm Centum Investments and 51% owned by Oman’s Gulf Energy. Sichuan Electric and Consulting Company Limited and Power Construction Corporation of China were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. This independent power project (IPP) was developed under a Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) structure and financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio.  The project’s construction start date was originally scheduled for September 2015 and the power plant was expected to be finished within 30 months by about 3,000 workers, including 1,400 Chinese workers. The plant’s commercial operations date (COD) was expected to occur no later than December 31, 2019. However, implementation was delayed due to environmentalists’ opposition to Kenya’s Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) issuing an energy generation license for the project. The project received environmental approval from Kenya’s National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) in September 2016, while Kenya’s Energy Regulatory Commission granted a development license for the project in February 2017. Then, on August 4, 2017, Amu Power Company Limited finalized a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Kenya Power and Light Company (KPLC). Soon thereafter, Kenya's National Treasury issued a formal letter of support for the project. However, the project continued to suffer delays due to environmental protests and legal hurdles.   The project was opposed by a number of environmental organizations, including Save Lamu and the Kwasasi Mvunjeni Farmers Self-Help Group (also known as the Kwasasi Farmers Self-Help Group). Save Lamu is a community-based umbrella organization made up of over 40 other organizations from Lamu, Kenya. The Kwasasi Mvunjeni Farmers Self-Help Group is a collective of farmers who have been displaced without compensation by infrastructure associated with the proposed 1,050-megawatt coal-fired power plant in Lamu. Save Lamu and the Kwasasi Mvunjeni Farmers Self-Help Group jointly opposed the project due to concerns about serious risks posed by the coal plant to their communities’ health, livelihoods, food security, environment and valuable cultural heritage. They claimed that “our farmers are being displaced from their land, losing their income and food security, without a clear plan for their compensation. Tourism and artisanal fishing, the two most important industries in Lamu, face existential threats from the plant’s potentially dramatic disruption of the distinct character of the area and the productivity of its marine environment. Indigenous communities are being further marginalised, losing access to critical natural and cultural resources that they have sustainably managed for generations. Our concerns about those risks have been exacerbated by the lack of meaningful community consultation and participation in project design.” On July 26, 2019, Kenya’s National Environmental  Tribunal (NET) ruled that the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) license for the Lamu coal-fired power plant in Kenya was insufficient (due to a lack of public participation) and that the construction had to be halted. Amu Power Company Limited appealed the decision. Then, on November 24, 2019, the African Development Bank (AfDB) announced that it would pull out of the project. According to project documents published by the project proponents, AfDB was expected to provide a partial risk guarantee for the project.   Then, on November 16, 2020, Save Lamu announced that ICBC had withdrawn from Lamu coal plant.  “We are very happy and grateful to hear that the ICBC will no longer fund Amu Power for the coal project. We as Save Lamu will always be there to defend its people and our environment; we don’t want a coal project in Lamu County and in Kenya at large,” said Is’haq Abubakar, Vice Chairperson at Save Lamu. Save Lamu had been using various approaches to lobby against the Lamu coal plant in the hope that investors such as ICBC would pull out including petitions, demonstrations, and other lobbying tactics.   If completed, the Lamu 981.5 MW power plant would have been the largest single power station in Kenya. The power generated would have been transmitted to Nairobi, the country's capital, via a new 520 kilometers (320 mi), 400 kiloVolt electricity transmission line. In the initial years, the station would utilize imported coal, mainly from South Africa, and later convert to locally sourced coal from the Mui Basin in Kitui County. 1.

58599,"China Development Bank provides $1.5 billion buyer's credit loan for Locomotive Equipment Acquisition Project (Linked to Project ID#58603, #70774) In 2013, Transnet launched its Market Demand Strategy (MDS), a ZAR 337 billion ($24.6 billion) investment program that included a plan to expand its fleet by 1064 locomotives. Then, in December 2014, President of South Africa Jacob Zuma and President of China Xi Jinping signed a Memorandum of Understanding, which included a pledge that China Development Bank (CDB) would provide a $2.5 billion loan to Transnet SOC Ltd (or “Transnet”), a South African state-owned railway company (Transnet老旧机车升级计划). Transnet reportedly considered the pricing of the CDB loan to be too expensive, and after 12 months of negotiations, it announced that it planned to borrow only $1.5 billion from CDB and supplement the loan with a separate R12 billion loan from a group of South African banks. Then, on April 16, 2015, a senior Transnet official concluded a ‘mandate letter’ for a CDB loan related to the acquisition of 232 diesel and 459 electric locomotives from China South Rail (CSR) Corporation and China North Rail (CNR) Corporation.   Then, on June 4, 2015, Transnet and CDB signed a $1.5 billion term (loan) facility agreement (Contract No.: 4110201501100000685) with the option of accessing an additional, ZAR-denominated 'standby facility' (worth ZAR 3 billion or $1 billion). The agreement was signed by Siyabonga Gama, the Acting Group Chief Executive of Transnet, and Li Gang, a Vice President of CDB. The $1.5 billion loan carried the following terms: a 15 year maturity, a 4.5 year grace period (54 months after the loan's first utilization date), an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 257 basis points, a default (penalty) interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.8%, and an arrangement (management) fee of 1.18% ($17,700,000). It was backed by two sources of collateral: a first fixed legal mortgage and a first fixed and floating charge ranking security over the locomotives procured from CNR and CSR. The borrower also reportedly purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure.   Under the terms of the facility agreement, Transnet is allowed use the proceeds of the loan to finance up to 85% (eighty five percent) of three commercial contracts: (1) a March 17, 2014 commercial contract that it signed with CSR E-Loco Supply Proprietary Limited (CSR) for the design, manufacture, test and supply of up to 359 new dual voltage electric locomotives (“electric locomotives""); (2) a March 17, 2014 commercial contract that it signed with CSR for the design, manufacture, test and supply of up to 100 new class 20E locomotives; and (3) a March 17, 2014 commercial contract that it signed with CNR for the design, manufacture, test and supply of 232 diesel locomotives. CSR and CNR reportedly complied with the minimum local content criteria for a rolling stock of 60% for electric locomotives and 55% for diesel locomotives.  On June 4, 2015, Transnet reported that it planned to draw down on the first $1.5 billion tranche of the loan over the next four years. Loan disbursements amounted to $464 million in 2016, $667 million in 2017, and $317 million in 2019. By the end of 2019, the $1.5 billion loan had achieved a 98.66% disbursement rate ($1.48 billion out of $1.5 billion).  The borrower is responsible for repaying the loan in 43, equal, quarterly installments on March 12, June 12, September 12, and December 12 of each year.  The purpose of the project was to acquire 232 diesel and 459 electric locomotives from CSR and CNR. As of 2016, Transnet had procured 591 of these locomotives.  However, the project was plagued by controversy and allegations that Transnet agreed to overpay CSR and CNR for their equipment in exchange for kickbacks to businesses owned by the wealthy Gupta family. On September 9, 2021, Reuters reported the South African Special Investigating Unit (SIU) froze $296.84 million belonging to CRRC E-Loco Supply Ltd., a local unit of CRRC Corporation Limited. SIU and the current management of Transnet asked for permanent confiscation of the funds. The action appeared to be in response to a long-running bribery scandal linked to former president Jacob Zuma and his business associates who allegedly received kickbacks for major infrastructure tenders in the country. According to SIU investigators, China South Rail (CSR) Corporation and China North Rail (CNR) Corporation, which later merged into CRRC Corporation, paid approximately 20 percent of the total amount of its deal with Transnet to a front company, Century General Trading, owned by the Gupta family, who were among Zuma’s business associates and who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department.  In its 2022 financial statements, Transnet noted that it was 'working closely with the SIU in recovering losses suffered as a result of wrongdoing. Following a report from the SIU about the conduct of a previous [Transnet] Group Executive, Transnet dismissed the Group Executive and successfully litigated with the SIU in the SIU Special Tribunal obtaining a judgment on 31 August 2021 in terms of which the previous executive was ordered to pay back to Transnet [ZAR 26.4] million for disgorgement of secret profits he earned while employed by Transnet. Transnet and the SIU also launched proceedings in the SIU Special Tribunal for the seizure and forfeiture of funds held by CRRC E-Locomotive Supply (previously known as China South Rail, one of the OEMs contracted to deliver locomotives in terms of the 1,064 locomotive supply agreements). Transnet and the SIU obtained an ex parte order against funds of CRRC held in various South African bank accounts and a final judgement in the matter is pending. Transnet is preparing legal papers to pursue further civil recovery in respect of parties implicated in SIU investigations and the findings of the Zondo Commission Report.'  1.

CDB agreed to participate in a cross-currency swap transaction in order to convert the USD based loan to a local currency ZAR loan.

The locomotive mortgage agreement is included in Schedule 8 of the 2015 term (loan) facility agreement. 11. The 2015 term (loan) facility agreement defines that 'locomotive mortgage' as 'each special notarial mortgage to be registered by the Borrower in favour of the Lender over the locomotives as described in and delivered pursuant to the terms of the Commercial Contracts and owned by the Borrower as security for the obligations of the Borrower to the Lender under the Transaction Finance Documents substantially in form of Schedule 8 (Locomotive Mortgage Agreement).'12. A cross-currency swap was necessary to hedge Transnet's liability to repay the loan in the currency in which it was received. A cross-currency swap is an off balance sheet (over the counter) transaction in which two parties exchange principal (principal portion of the loan) in different currencies. The hedge takes the liquidity risk out of the equation. The CDB loan was arranged as a floating rate loan denominated in USD with periodic drawdowns that occurred to pay either CNR or CSR in respect of the 1064 locomotive procurement. The locomotive supply agreements between Transnet and CNR and CSR provided for payments to be made in ZAR. Consequently, the CDB (loan) facility needed to be swapped from USD to ZAR at each drawdown. Transnet accordingly entered into hedging transactions with JP Morgan in the form of a series of cross-currency swaps. JP Morgan in this case acted as the sole hedge counterparty to lead and underwrite the equivalent ZAR amount for a loan of $1.5 billion.13.

Phase 2 of the Dar es Salaam Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project involves the construction of infrastructure that includes 20.3 km of exclusive BRT lanes and Non Motorised Transport (NMT) facilities along Kilwa Road corridor and part of Kawawa Road. The project corridor traverses from Mbagala Area in Temeke District to the Central Business District where it connects with Phase 1 of the BRT system at the Kariakoo hub. In addition to the construction of road infrastructure, the project involves the construction of 29 bus stations, one bus depot at Mbagala-Rangitatu and two bus terminals at Mbagala-Rangitatu and Kariakoo-Gerezani. Moreover, two flyovers; one at Nyerere Road/Chang’ombe Road junction and second at Nelson Mandela/Kilwa road junction are to be constructed. Non-Motorized Transport facilities and five feeder stations at Dar es Salaam University College of Education (DUCE), Mtoni Kwa Azizi Ali, Mbagala-Rangitatu, Zakhiem and Mtoni-Kijichi are also to be provided. A pedestrian overpass bridge will be constructed at Mbagala area. Alongside infrastructure development, feeders’ stations for Phase 2 are identified at Charambe and Kongowe, all being connected to Mbagala Rangitatu, Mtoni kwa Azizi Alli that connects North and South Tandika, Mtoni, Temeke and Buza while Kijichi Misheni connects Misheni, Kijichi and Mbagala Kuu. Another feeder route is the DUCE-Chang’ombe which connects Temeke, Kigamboni and Tandika area.  The project is expected to benefit an estimated population of at least 1.2 million representing some 25% of the Dar es Salaam City’s population. Other beneficiaries include users of major city connecting arterial roads including Mandela and Nyerere Roads. Key outcomes include improved accessibility to the larger populations of Dar es Salaam particularly Temeke Municipality, reduced travel time to public transport commuters, improved air quality to travelers and residents living close to the roadway, improved property values arising from reduced congestion, and improved business environment for traders arising from improved accessibility, new market facilities and improved sanitation. The disadvantaged women, school children, handicapped and elderly are also poised to benefit from the new BRT system. At the moment, they cannot manage to comfortably use the existing public transport especially during peak hours. Finally, employment will be created during both the construction phase and the operations phases of the proposed BRT line. The provision of BRT system is expected to directly enhance and improve the traffic circulation and eliminate bottlenecks to traffic flow to various economic activity centers such as the industrial zones, and the vast populous residential areas of Temeke Municipality. The project is therefore expected to impact positively on the informal and formal businesses by providing them with improved accessibility and enhanced roadside air quality. It is further estimated that by improving the existing road and public transport system, the annual vehicular GHG emission rates in tones would drop by at least 60% due to improved average traffic operating speeds along the project corridor and particularly by the use large modern buses that uses modern technology and cleaner fuels in the BRT system.  The originally expected project implementation start date was April 27, 2016 and the originally expected project completion date was December 31, 2020. The project ultimately commenced on March 1, 2019. It suffered significant delays in procurement due to lengthy design review process. As of September 2019, all land acquisition activities were completed and construction activities were underway. 1. The all-in interest rate (1.128%) was calculated by adding an 0.6% margin to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in October 2015 (0.528%).2.

The project is jointly financed by the Bank Group (61.1%), Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF) (27.8%) and the Government of Tanzania (11.1%).5. The entire Phase 2 trunk system of 20.3 kilometers will be built along the middle of existing roads. A 9m wide median along Kilwa road is currently reserved for BRT lanes, terminals and stations. Throughout the entire corridor, there will be tree-shaded bicycle and pedestrian ways on both sides of the road. The average distance between bus stops will be 500 meters and system users will be encouraged to either walk or bicycle to the bus stops (privately operated bicycle parking facilities are planned at each bus stop). Ninety seven (97) articulated trunk buses with a capacity of 140 passengers will provide both normal (stopping at all stations) and express services (stopping only at connector stations). Additionally, a system of 105 feeder buses with a capacity of 60 passengers will transport passengers to the trunk system through feeder stations. Trunk buses will be accessed at the stations by the passengers at level which will enhance system capacity and comfort. The system is expected to operate for 18 hours from 5am to 11 pm. The bus fleet which will be under separate financing arrangement and operated by a Private Bus Operator and is expected to serve 495,000 passenger trips per day of which approximately 50% are women and 150 million trips annually.  The project involves the construction of BRT infrastructure along Kilwa Road from Mbagala to CBD (14.9 km), and Changombe Road to Kawawa Road (5.4 km) connecting to Phase 1 line at Magomeni area. The construction includes Terminals, Depots, Feeder Stations, NMT facilities and flyovers at Nyerere/Kawawa and Mandela/Kilwa roads intersection. The works on Kilwa road involve constructing two BRT lanes in the right of way provided in the center of existing mixed traffic lanes with service roads, bicycle lanes and pedestrian walkways.

One component of the project is the ""Permanent Link between Motorway A4 and the town of Bizerte in Tunisia,” which is a 9.5 km-long urban expressway (reference speed of 80 km/h) permanently linking motorway A4 to the town of Bizerte, including the canal crossing through a viaduct. The new infrastructure is a peri-urban expressway with interchanges of varying heights. Pedestrian traffic is forbidden on the main road, including on the viaduct. The project is sub-divided into three lots, namely: Lot 1: South Road: ""South road section. Interchange A4/ RN8 – viaduct"". PK0+000 to PK4+659. This road layout mainly follows a corridor on the outskirts of urban centres, bypasses Zarzouna and crosses Menzel Abderrahmen. The layout comprises three intersection points with interchanges of completely different heights. Lot 2: Viaduct: ""Viaduct with a mixed meshwork and combined double action deck"". PK4+659 to PK6+729. Lot 2 is an imposing 2,070 m-long viaduct that crosses the canal with three spans, the main 293 m-long span supported by two v-shaped single piers directing the navigation canal. Lot 3: North Road: ""North road section. Viaduct – RL348. PK6+729 to PK9+446"" is a 2.7 km-long road extension of this link beyond the viaduct to the north of the canal, like a northern bypass of the town, to improve access to the town of Bizerte. The road layout extends beyond RN11 to RL438 with a roundabout.    PMIR  also  seeks to upgrade  some  civil  engineering structures on the classified network to make them more resilient to the effects of climate change and  give  them  features  that  are  consistent  with  the  service  level  and  the  expected  traffic  on  the network. Considering its scope and the major environmental and social impacts identified, the project was classified under Environmental Category 1, in accordance with the environmental and social assessment procedures of the African Development Bank (AfDB). An environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) was conducted in 2015 and 2016 respectively for the permanent link and its extension and finalized in 2017. A full resettlement plan (FRP) was also prepared and finalized in 2017. The ESIA reports were approved by Tunisia’s National Environmental Protection Agency (ANPE) and compliance opinions were issued on December 31, 2016 and May 10, 2017 for the permanent link and its extension, respectively. Project implementation commenced in 2016 and was still underway as of July 2022. The project’s originally expected completion date was October 31, 2022. 1. The AfDB project identification number is P-TN-DB0-013. 2.  The all-in interest rate was calculated by adding an 0.6% margin to the average 6-month EURIBOR rate in November 2015 (0.053%). 3. The margin of 0.6% is calculated by adding the Funding Cost Margin (unknown) to the Contractual Margin (0.6%). 4.

36211,"China Eximbank provides $645.82 million buyer’s credit loan for 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission Lines and Sub-stations Project (Linked to Project ID#30919) On December 18, 2014 and February 20, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed two loan agreements worth a total of $1,435,158,682 for the 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project. Then, on February 27, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified these two loan agreements. The first loan agreement with China Eximbank, captured via Project ID#36211, is a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. 140302052015210069] worth $645,821,407.12 that was signed on February 20, 2015 with the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. Under the terms of the BCL, the Government to Uganda is responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The second China Eximbank loan agreement, captured via Project ID#30919, is a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 46 TOTAL NO. (340)] worth $789,337,275.36 that was signed on December 18, 2014 with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 0.25% management fee (worth $1,973,343.19), and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the BCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a $1,688,421,979.39 commercial contract between the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which was signed on August 16, 2013 and amended on May 6, 2014 and May 15, 2014 (via Addendum No. 1 and Addendum No. 2). The borrower was to use the BCL proceeds to finance 38.25% of the commercial contract cost and the PBC proceeds to finance 46.75% of the commercial contract cost.   The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for both China Eximbank loans, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of these loans to open escrow accounts with Stanbic Bank and deposit funds in the accounts over the terms of the loans to facilitate repayment and provide security in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of one of these escrow (repayment reserve) accounts was UGX 87,154,247,132 ($26,146,274.13).  UMEME Ltd. became the major privately owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network. It was involved as a contractual signatory to the Karuma PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. Loan repayments to China Eximbank were to be made through electricity payments under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with UETCL and UMEME Ltd. According to the terms of the loan agreements and the PPA, UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on “take or pay” basis, which means that UETCL was responsible for paying for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreements because they stated that “the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.”   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the PBC achieved a 85.4% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 24 loan disbursements (worth $674,527,385.55) between 2015 and 2020: a $101,179,038 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $16,324,648 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $16,009,159 disbursement on December 28, 2015, a $23,583,642.35 disbursement on April 27, 2016, a $11,850,199 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $37,208,639 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $18,949,811 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $8,637,526 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $6,927,809 disbursement on June 27, 2016, a $43,705,347.25 disbursement on September 6, 2017, a $28,149,577.68 disbursement on October 18, 2017, a $12,649,419.75 disbursement on November 14, 2017, a $39,929,383.45 disbursement on December 26, 2017, a $48,155,261.48 disbursement on April 13, 2018, a $13,785,395.25 disbursement on May 31, 2018, a $65,799,750.54 disbursement on October 19, 2018, a $7,308,794.90 disbursement on December 25, 2018, a $41,827,450.63 disbursement on February 28, 2019, a $36,212,516.45 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $13,979,022.20 disbursement on June 20, 2019, a $52,698,924.89 disbursement on November 13, 2019, a $10,010,402.52 disbursement on December 19, 2019, a $14,101,813.11 disbursement on March 20, 2020, and a $5,543,854.10 disbursement on August 18, 2020.   According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $674,527,385.55 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $674,527,385.55.  According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the BCL achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 31 loan disbursements (worth $625,602,535.38) between 2015 and 2021: a $31,356,497 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $30,767,223 disbursement on January 29, 2016, a $58,068,539 disbursement on March 7, 2016, a $8,341,230.65 disbursement on May 26, 2016, a $9,695,618 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $30,443,431 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $15,504,390 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $7,067,066 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $5,668,207 disbursement on June 29, 2017, a $22,395,381 disbursement on September 1, 2017, a $13,363,539.75 disbursement on September 8, 2017, a $23,031,472.65 disbursement on October 17, 2017, a $10,349,525.25 disbursement on November 15, 2017, a $32,669,495.55 disbursement on December 19, 2017, a $39,399,759.39 disbursement on April 20, 2018, a $11,278,959.75 disbursement on May 29, 2018, a $53,836,159.53 disbursement on October 18, 2018, a $5,979,923.10 disbursement on December 24, 2018, a $34,222,459.61 disbursement on March 1, 2019, a $29,628,422.56 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $11,437,381.80 disbursement on June 19, 2019, a $43,117,302.18 disbursement on November 12, 2019, a $8,190,329.33 disbursement on December 20, 2019, a $11,537,847.09 disbursement on March 19, 2010, a $8,362,437.84 disbursement on August 19, 2020, a $16,193,030.50 disbursement on November 5, 2020, a $9,772,888.57 disbursement on August 26, 2021, a $8,920,595.93 on March 17, 2022, a $10,602,602.45 disbursement on May 9, 2022, a $14,822,335.90 disbursement on June 17, 2022, and a $9,578,484 disbursement on August 18, 2022.  According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total disbursements under the BCL amounted to $581,678,517 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $517,096,376.38.   On July 28, 2021, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a supplementary agreement to the BCL agreement [ID#14030205015210069A], which extended the loan's availability (disbursement) period to allow for $73,915,778.59 of undisbursed funds to be utilized by the borrower (after the original availability period expired on December 24, 2020). The supplementary agreement also specified that, if the loan fully disbursed, the borrower would be responsible for making twenty, semi-annual repayments (worth $32,291,070.36 each) between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2030.  The 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project., which is also known as the Karuma Hydropower Plant and Interconnection Project, will involve the installation of 6 turbines (10 million kilowatts each), which will create a total capacity of 600 MW, making it Uganda's largest power plant. After the first two turbines start generating electricity, the remaining four turbines will be turned on once per month. The project includes dams, water diversion pipes, underground power plants, and transmission lines. The purpose of the Interconnection Project is to evacuate power produced from Karuma Hydropower Plant in Northern Uganda to load centers, which include Lira and Olwiyo in Northern Uganda, and Kawanda in Central Uganda. It will involve construction of a 248km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Kawanda transmission line; a 78km, 132kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Lira Transmission Line; a 55km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Olwiyo transmission Line (which will be initially operated at 132kV); a new 400/132kV sub-station interconnecting with Karuma HPP and 400kV line bays; a new 400kV/220kV substation with two new incoming 400kV line bays to interface with the existing Kawanda 220/132kV substation; two new incoming 132kV line bays to interface with the existing Lira 132/33kV substation; and a new 132/33kV Olwiyo substation.   The EPC contractor responsible for implementation of this project was Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The construction of the dam and power station officially started on August 12, 2013. As of March 2016, about 30% of the work had been completed. In October 2016, it was estimated that about 1,000 Chinese nationals and about 5,000 Ugandans were working at the power station. As of June 2018, 56 months from the beginning of construction, an estimated 76% of the physical work had been completed. Of the 6,000 workers, 5,300 were Ugandan. As of September 2019, an estimated 95% of construction activities had been completed, which included 100% completion of the Karuma–Lira High Voltage Line, 100% of the Karuma–Kawanda High Voltage Power Line and 98% of the Karuma–Olwiyo High Voltage Line. As of December 2020, the Karuma Hydropower dam had reached a 98.7% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Kawanda transmission line had reached a 99.5% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Lira transmission line had reached a 86.4% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Olwiyo transmission line had reached a 95.5% physical progress rate, and the Karuma, Kawanda, Olwiyo, and Lira substations have reached 99.9%, 99.9%, 93% and 99% physical progress rates, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was considered a force major event in that it constrained manufacturing and prevented the shipping of equipment and the travel of experts to facilitate the installation and commissioning of equipment. Other project implementation challenges have included a dispute between the EPC contractor and a sub-contractor, which halted the finalization of the stringing and energizing of a 2.504 km transmission line; UMEME distribution lines without required minimum clearances at Walusi, and Wabigalo; the vandalism of tower materials; accusations of public waste and corruption; the death of a worker due to allegedly unsafe work practices; and accusations that one worker was engaged in ivory smuggling activities. The cost of the project also reportedly ballooned from $1.68 billion at least $2.2 billion. 1. In July 2016, the Government of Uganda concluded an an interest rate swap deal with Standard Bank and Standard Chartered on its China Eximbank BCL loan. Under the terms of the deal, the Government of Uganda agreed to pay a fixed interest rate of 2.58 percent (0.79 plus a swap premium of 1.79) on its loan, allowing Standard Bank and Standard Chartered to pay the floating interest, which is dependent on LIBOR. Thus, the Government of Uganda only benefits from the arrangement when LIBOR plus the agreed premium is higher than 2.58 percent. According to the Government of Uganda, the purpose of engaging in this interest rate swap was “to ensure certainty and hedge against future [LIBOR] rate fluctuations. However, as of 2018, the Government of Uganda had not yet benefited from the interest rate swap arrangement because the floating rate remained below 2.58 percent. As a result, the Government of Uganda incurred additional costs that it would not have incurred in the absence of the interest rate swap arrangement. 2. In the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020 and the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, a single, $1.4 billion China Eximbank loan for the 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission Lines and Sub-stations Project project is identified. However, AidData records two separate China Eximbank loans for this project (a PBC and a BCL) based on the loan agreements themselves. SAIS-CARI also records only one set of borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and 2% interest rate. However, PBC and BCL agreements specify that these loans carry different borrowing terms. The BCL carries an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. The PBC carries a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 0.25% management fee (worth $1,973,343.19), and a 0.25% commitment fee. The PBC agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/znwu46a5h6vsclk/China%20EximBank%20Loan%20-%20Karuma%20Hydropower%20Dam%20and%20associated%20works%20Project%20PBC%20%282014%29%2046%20Total%20No%20340.pdf?dl=0.

AidData has calculated the BCL’s all-in interest rate by taking the average 6-month LIBOR rate in November 2014 (0.327%) and adding a 3.5% margin. Therefore, the all-in interest rate is coded as 3.827%. 4. On July 28, 2021, the BCL agreement was amended in order to extend the loan’s disbursement period by two additional years (to allow for $73.915 million of unutilized funds to be utilized by the borrower). The amended agreement [No. 140302052015210069A] can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/kklgyc75pkwedat/Supplementary%20Agreement%20to%20Buyer%20Credit%20Loan%20Agreement%20for%20Karuma%20HPP.pdf?dl=0. 5. The collateralization arrangement that governs the BCL and the PBC is described in detail in Article 6.12 of the PBC agreement and Article 12.k of the BCL agreement. Both loan agreements define the ‘security document’ as ‘each of the agreements and legal documents signed by the relevant parties for the purposes of creating security interests in favor of the Lender and enhancing the credit of the Borrower as stipulated in Article 6.12, including without limitation the On-lending Agreement(s), the Escrow Account, the Repayment Reserve Account Agreement, the Power Purchase Agreement, the Power Sales Agreement and the Assignment Agreement/Debenture.

(6) The Borrower shall procure each of UEGCL and UETCL as assignor/chargor to sign with the Lender assignee/chargee the Assignment Agreements/Debenture in forma and substance acceptable to the Lender, which which UEGCL and UETCL shall assign and/or pledge, among others, all its assignable rights and interests and revenue under the Power Purchase Agreement and the Power Sales Agreement (as the case may be) to the Lender. (7) The Borrower undertakes to ensure that the successors of permitted assignees and transferee of the parties of the Security Documents shall abide by the provisions of the relevant Security Documents. (8) Notwithstanding the existence of the Security Document, the Borrower shall be fully liable for the payment and repayment obligations under this Agreement. 6. The Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement shall not be affected or undermined by the execution, delivery and performance by the relevant parties of such Security Documents.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘Assignment Agreement/Debenture’ as ‘each or both (as the context may require) or (i) the assignment agreement/debenture entered into or to be entered into between UEGCL as assignor/chargor and the Lender as assignee/chargee, under which UEGCL shall assign and/or pledge, among others, all its assignable rights and interest under the Power Purchase Agreement to the Lender; and (ii) the assignment agreement/debenture entered into or to be entered into between UETCL as assignor/chargor and the Lender as assignee/chargee, under which UETCL shall assign and/or pledge, among others, all its assignable rights and interests and revenues under the Power Sales Agreement to the Lender, both of which are in form and substance acceptable to the Lender.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘Escrow Account Agreement’ as the ‘escrow account agreement entered into to or to be entered into among the Lender, the Borrower, and other relevant parties as well as the Escrow Account Bank in respect of opening, maintenance and control of the Sales Collection Account and in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. The BCL and PBC define the ‘Escrow Account Bank’ as the ‘Export-Import Bank of China and/or such other reputable international bank registered in Uganda and approved by the lender.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘On-Lending Agreement(s)’ as the ‘loan agreement(s) entered into or to be entered into between the Borrower and the lender and UEGCL and UETCL as co-borrowers (whereby the Borrower enters into separate on-lending agreement with each of UEGCL and UETCL respectively); whereby the proceeds of the Facility are on-lent by the Borrower to UEGCL and UETCL to implement the Project.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘Power Purchase Agreement’ as the ‘power purchase agreement entered into or to be entered into between UEGCL as seller and UETCL as purchaser under the ‘Take or Pay’ terms in connection with the Project, in form and substance acceptable to the Lender.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘Power Sales Agreement’ as the ‘power sales agreement entered into or to be entered into between UETCL as seller and relevant distributor(s) related to the Project as purchaser under the ‘Take or Pay’ terms in connection with the Project, in form and substance acceptable to the Lender.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘Repayment Reserve Account’ as ‘the account in the name of the Borrower with the Lender and for the purpose of maintaining the minimum amount of the funds as debt service reserve pursuant to the Escrow Account Agreement.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘Repayment Reserve Account Agreement’ as ‘the repayment reserve account agreement entered into or to be entered into among the Lender, the Borrower, and other relevant parties in respect of the opening, maintenance and control of the Repayment Reserve Account and in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender.’ The BCL and PBC define the ‘Sales Collection Account’ as ‘the account in the name of UEGCL and/or UETCL or other relevant parties with the Escrow Account Bank and for the purpose of collecting revenues generated from the Project pursuant to the Escrow Account Agreement.’ 7. The revenues generated by this project flow through a ‘cashflow waterfall’ arrangement (usefully described via https://pivotal180.com/project-finance-cash-flow-waterfall/ and https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=26f2629e-2040-4dda-a6d8-6600e478cf7f). 8. Under the terms of the BCL agreement, the borrower is responsible for paying 20 installments of $32,291,070.28 every six months between January 2021 and July 2030.

59750,"China Eximbank provides RMB 96.9 million government concessional loan for Phase 3 of National Transmission Backbone and e-Government Infrastructure Project (Linked to Project ID#53401 and Project ID#53402) On March 31, 2015, the Chinese Government and the Government of Uganda signed a preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 3 of the National Transmission Backbone and e-Government Infrastructure Project. On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda (represented by the Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development) signed an RMB 96,966,600 ($15,391,522) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 4 TOTAL NO. (543)] for Phase 3 of the National Transmission Backbone and e-Government Infrastructure Project. The Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development then on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to National Information Technology Authority Uganda (NITA-U). The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The GCL is secured by (collateralized against) a minimum cash balance in a lender-controlled bank account (see staff comment #6 for more details). The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $15,391,522 commercial (turnkey) contract [ID#0008000610060C] between the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Information and Communication Technology and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed on July 15, 2010 and amended on December 30, 2013.   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 94.8% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making x loan disbursements (worth $14,604,878.74) between 2015 and 2017: a $4,619,644.65 disbursement on September 30, 2015, a $5,192,303.56 disbursement on September 30, 2016, a $2,145,289.98 disbursement on April 19, 2017, a $2,553,844.51 disbursement on June 28, 2017, and a $93,796.05 disbursement on December 21, 2017. According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $15,227,167.16 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $14,212,022.68. Phase 3 involved laying fiber optic cable to connect Masaka, Mbarara, Kabale, the Katuna border post, and the Mutukula border post. It also the completion of the Kyenjojo-Masindi fiber optic cable link. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation.

59753,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.26 billion loan for Phase 1 of Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project On March 31, 2015, the Chinese Government and the Government of Uganda signed a preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project. On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed an RMB 1,260,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 6 TOTAL NO. (545)] for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project.  Uganda’s Parliament then ratified the loan agreement on July 29, 2015. Several months later, on November 17, 2015, the Government of Uganda entered into a subsidiary, on-lending agreement with Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% (RMB 3,150,000) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first scheduled loan repayment date is April 1, 2022.   The GCL is secured by (collateralized against) airport revenues deposited in a lender-controlled bank account with a minimum cash balance requirement. A December 3, 2015 escrow account agreement between the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, Stanbic Bank Uganda Limited, UCAA, and China Eximbank specifies that the borrower must maintain a minimum cash balance in the repayment reserve account of RMB 25,200,000 during the loan’s grace period (equivalent to total payable interest for one year during the loan’s grace period) and RMB 98,870,000 during the loan’s repayment period (equivalent to total payable principal and interest for one year during the loan’s repayment period). The GCL agreement also specifies that the 'all the revenues (proceeds) of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable [to the lender].' Under the terms of an Escrow Account Agreement, UCAA also agreed to (a) seek secure advance approval from China Eximbank for any use of the airport revenues that it deposits in the escrow account; and (b) grant China Eximbank approval authority over the airport’s annual budgets.   The ultimate borrower/end-user (UCAA) is expected to use the GCL proceeds to finance a $200,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between UCAA and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed on October 8, 2014 and amended on January 12, 2015.   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 78% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 26 loan disbursements (worth $156,639,169.44) between 2015 and 2021: a $60,124,334.71 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $9,822,292.39 disbursement on November 15, 2016, a $4,473,339.53 disbursement on December 14, 2016, a $5,272,753.02 disbursement on March 29, 2017, a $2,363,019.84 disbursement on April 20, 2017, a $1,336,370.91 disbursement on May 25, 2017, a $1,237,900.78 disbursement on August 10, 2017, a $5,492,164.36 disbursement on November 21, 2017, a $3,445,536.22 disbursement on December 27, 2017, a $21,668,252.97 disbursement on April 19, 2019, a $3,032,693.76 disbursement on May 30, 2019, a $3,743,156.53 disbursement on August 22, 2019, a $3,074,851.76 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a $2,911,749.34 disbursement on November 25, 2019, a $2,683,403.29 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a $1,275,590.33 disbursement on April 27, 2020, a $3,197,241.55 disbursement on May 27, 2020, a $1,758,890.15 disbursement on July 24, 2020, a $1,831,735.75 disbursement on August 7, 2020, a $1,944,401.91 disbursement on September 28, 2020, a $3,835,965.97 disbursement on December 18, 2020, a $4,414,162.60 disbursement on November 24, 2021, a $3,128,465.91 disbursement on March 30, 2022, a $2,110,577.92 disbursement on August 17, 2022, a $1,314,054.62 disbursement on November 17, 2022, and a $1,146,263.31 disbursement on December 13, 2022.  According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $155,982,698.23 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $155,982,698.23.   The purpose of the project’s first phase is to upgrade and expand Entebbe International Airport. The airport is located at 5 minutes from the main campus of Kampala International University, near the town of Entebbe, on the shores of Lake Victoria, and approximately 40.5 kilometers (25 mi) by road south-west of the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. Its exact locational coordinates are 00°02′41″N 032°26′35″E”. Phase 1 activities include constructing a new cargo terminal, resurfacing the main runway with new lighting, constructing a new terminal building (that is adjacent and connected to the existing terminal and with aerobridges), repairing, strengthening and expanding the main apron serving the existing terminal and the new terminal, repairing the second runway and associated taxiways, repairing Apron 2 (which serves VVIPs or Very Very Important Persons), strengthening Apron 4 (which serves general aviation and cargo aircraft), replacing aging navigation aids, and constructing a multi-story car park. The total cost of Phase 1 is $200 million and the total cost of Phase 2 is $125 million. These two phases were originally expected to take 5 years to implement. It is expected that, upon completion, the expanded and upgraded airport will increase annual passenger output at the airport from 1.5 million to 3.5 million and freight volume of the completed freight center from 55,000 tons to 100,000 tons CCCC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Dar Al-Handasah (Shair & Partners) is responsible for project supervision. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 29, 2015. Construction began on May 10, 2016. As of June 2019, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate. As of October 26, 2021, the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform summarized the status of the project in the following manner: ‘Physical Progress: The overall performance of the civil works currently stands at 50%. One runway is complete; works on the runway apron are halfway and 80% of the works on the cargo building have been achieved. Challenges: Overdue IPC Payments which have led to accrual of interest charges e.g accrued interest for [Interim Payment Certificate]# 1 up to [Interim Payment Certificate] #23 as of July 11th 2019 stood at USD 951,368.49. This increases by the month. Progress of the Cargo Terminal and Airfield Works continues but require intense supervision to ensure acceptable workmanship and approved materials are employed. Some [overdue] approved materials for the Cargo Complex are not yet delivered to [the project site], meaning that delays encountered so far will not be recovered. The project still reports approximately Eleven Months delay and the Contractor [CCCC] is still reluctant to [reprogram its] work in accordance with Clause 8.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, to include measures intended to recover lost time. It is also evident that project completion cannot be achieved by May 2021. In addition, challenges for construction include coordination difficulties with the extensive fuel network (by Tristar) and with Airport Operations, Safety and Security, due to the naturally intrusive nature of construction within an operational environment. Runway 17/35 and Apron 1 Works are particularly noted in this respect.  By November 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate or 75.1%. Then, in March 2022, construction of the cargo terminal was completed. Li Qinpu, a project manager of the CCCC, said at the peak of the construction of the cargo terminal, the project employed 80 Chinese workers and more than 900 local workers at different skills levels. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by May 9, 2021. However, this date was subsequently pushed out to December 5, 2022. The expected completion date of the project’s second phase (which had not yet secured financing as of March 2022) is March 2024. The Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project has become a source of local and international controversy. One set of concerns relate to the potentially inflated cost of the underlying commercial contract. CCCC (the EPC contractor) pre-financed the feasibility study for the design and implementation of project. The feasibility study report submitted to CAA in December 2013 costed Phase 1 of the project at $200,000,000, which paved the way for the signing of a $200,000,000 commercial contract between CAA and CCCC on October 2014. There was, however, no independent review of the feasibility estimates by UCAA during the procurement stage which would have informed the Government of Uganda on the reasonableness and accuracy of the cost estimates prior to agreeing to CCCC securing the funds from China Eximbank.   Additionally, the UCAA contracts committee approved the project cost in the feasibility study on September 23, 2014 without undertaking an independent evaluation of these costs. Another set of concerns relate to the collateralization arrangement that underpins the China Eximbank loan agreement and an Escrow Account Agreement in which UCAA reportedly granted China Eximbank approval authority over the Entebbe International Airport’s annual budgets and UCAA’s use of revenues from the airport in the escrow account. The loan agreement states that repayment of the China Eximbank loan is the responsibility of the “end user” (CAA) and the escrow account (established as a requirement of the loan agreement to facilitate repayment) should be funded using airport revenues. However, in January 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General revealed that the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development had made interest payments on the loan and but not deposited airport revenues in the escrow account. The Auditor General also noted that “inconsistencies in the operationalization of the agreements and the involved parties’ deemed actions represent non-compliance/ breach of contract that could result in penalties and even cancellation of the [loan] facility.” By March 2019, China Eximbank responded to the borrower’s non-compliance with escrow account conditions by halting loan disbursements, which in turn led to the Government of Uganda falling behind on payments to CCCC (the EPC contractor). This resulted in major construction delays. CCCC’s payment certificates 11-23 (worth $24.5 million) for work performed between December 2017 and February 2019 were not paid, which led to a project implementation standstill that lasted for 361 days. UCAA later told a parliamentary oversight body that “[t]hese [escrow account] conditions were not palatable for an international airport of a sovereign state whose operations are dynamic and sometimes unpredictable.” The Government of Uganda responded on March 6, 2019 by dispatching an 11-member delegation (consisting of CAA officials, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development officials, the Deputy Solicitor General, and Uganda’s Ambassador to China, H.E. Dr. Crispus C.W. Kiyonga) to Beijing to renegotiate so-called ‘toxic clauses’ in the loan agreement with China Eximbank. According to an internal Government of Uganda record (a September 5, 2019 memo/letter from Finance Minister Matia Kasaija to Public Works Minister Monica Azuba Ntege), “[w]hile the initial agenda was to cause a re-negotiation of specific clauses in the original financing agreement that seemed very unsuitable to [the Government of Uganda] and therefore to the end user (UCAA), the [China Eximbank] officials made it clear from the onset that re-negotiation and amendment of the loan agreement were not agreeable to them. The Bank proposed, which the [Government of Uganda delegation] found plausible, that rather than having a re-negotiation, we could have a ‘clarification’ of the contentious clauses with a view of having a workable interpretation. It was the understanding of all parties that to achieve a win-win situation, the contentious clauses would be interpreted with a view of having a balanced effect that would enable resumption of disbursement without necessarily amending the agreement. The Bank’s view was that such an amendment if allowed would set a bad precedent and more so, they saw no cause to warrant the amendment.   In that regard, it was agreed that: i) The Bank resumes financing through disbursements and makes flexible the conditions set around the Escrow Account Agreement clauses especially the provision requiring UCAA to deposit all airport revenues [in] this account. The Bank clarified that the objective of the sales collection account was to see [UCAA’s] inflows and outflows for this account and that since the minimum reserve amount was already available on the debt reserve payment account, the funds would henceforth be available for [UCAA’s] operations. It was agreed that the Borrower [the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development] shares proof of the banking on the sales collection account as a trigger for the Bank to unlock disbursements. This has since been implemented. ii) Another contentious matter that the delegation wanted to be varied was the provision requiring UCAA to submit for approval all their operational budgets to [China Eximbank]. The Bank clarified that they were interested in the project budget but since this budget was subsumed in other UCAA operational activities, UCAA was henceforth required to share approved budgets with the Bank for review only and not for approval.” China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda delegation also reportedly agreed to keep the details of their meeting (‘minutes of the meeting’) confidential. Then, on December 20, 2019, Uganda’s Office of the Auditor General publish a report that criticized Uganda’s Ministry of Finance for the borrowing terms in the Entebbe airport loan agreement and several other loan agreements with China Eximbank: “A review of the various facility agreements for issued [China Eximbank] loans revealed that the [Government of Uganda] was obliged to open escrow accounts where the government was expected to make advance deposit of funds over the tenure of the loan required for the repayment of the loan. It was observed that some of the escrow bank accounts are held with local commercial banks while others are held in the Lenders countries. […] The funds are deposited on commercial bank accounts upfront and the creditors have access to them before even the loans are disbursed. Government of Uganda has no control over these accounts. The practice causes financial strain to the cash flows of the country and maybe as a result of weaknesses in negotiations that are undertaken by the government of Uganda and the lenders. These funds could have been used as advance to start the implementation of the projects for which the financing is required. The practice distorts the Government [of Uganda]s] cash flows and monetary control policy. The [Government of Uganda’s] Accounting Officer promised to improve on the way [the Government] negotiate[s] loans with escrow conditionalities. [Uganda’s Auditor General] advised the Accounting [Officer] to in future avoid loans with such unfavourable terms or negotiate to have such terms softened.”   Then, in October 2021, a parliamentary panel led by opposition politicians revealed that the Government of Uganda’s arrangement with China Eximbank requires that all of UCAA’s revenues and expenditures pass through accounts controlled by China Eximbank at a Kampala branch of South Africa’s Standard Bank Group Ltd. (Stanbic Bank), which is itself partly owned by Beijing’s biggest state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Members of Parliament’s Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprise (Cosase) raised questions and concerns about the wisdom of granting financial oversight power (and influence over which creditors get paid first) — normally reserved for the country’s treasury and parliament — to a Chinese state-owned bank. They also questioned the wisdom of the Ugandan Government limiting its own ability to tap into revenue from rapidly expanding tourism and exports. [Note: Entebbe International Airport is a regional hub airport. Traffic has soared over the past decade and is expected to grow more amid a $15 billion crude-oil development project along Uganda’s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.] Joel Ssenyonyi, a member of parliament who led the panel, said “It’s appalling. […] that [China Eximbank] now has to approve any budget spending [of UCAA].” On October 28, 2021, Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija was called before the parliamentary panel and questioned over the terms of the loan. He apologized to the lawmakers, noting that “we shouldn’t have accepted some of the clauses. [...] But they told you . . . either you take it or leave it.” He also said the loan would be repaid and there was no chance that the airport would be seized by the lender. Then, on November 25, 2021, a local newspaper in Uganda (The Daily Monitor) published a report, which suggested that the China Eximbank loan agreement “if not amended, [could] expose Uganda's sovereign assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in Beijing.” Two days later, on November 27, 2021, UCAA Spokesperson Vianney M Luggya tweeted that “It is true that @UgandaCAA opened up a Sales Collection Account in @stanbicug where all the [UCAA’s] revenues are deposited in line with the Escrow Account Agreement terms, but it does not mean that anyone is to control our finances.” Luggya also tweeted that “The [UCAA] enjoys the freedom & liberty of spending what is collected (as per the budget). The lender’s monitoring of the account is only similar to what happens when one gets a salary loan or any other loan, & the bank requests that the salary is channeled through their bank. It does not mean that lending bank takes over your salary.” In late 2021, internal disagreements within the executive branch of the Ugandan Government also spilled into public view. Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija reportedly advocated for adherence to the agreement that the Government of Uganda struck with China Eximbank in March 2019 (as codified in the ‘minutes of the meeting’). However, UCAA and the Ministry of Public Works reportedly treated Kasaija’s position ‘with disdain for allegedly blind-spotting a deal that presents real risks to Uganda's sovereign assets.’ UCAA officials reportedly flagged up to 13 clauses in the China Eximbank agreement as ""unfair” or a threat to “the sovereignty of Uganda.” A confidential source told the a local newspaper in Uganda that “it’s clear that [U]CAA will lose its rights of use and control over its revenues […] as a self-financing institution with limited funding. Such provisions would expose the [organization] to risk of failure in service delivery and bankruptcy.” In June 2020, David Kakuba, who was the Director General of UCAA at that time, warned that granting China Eximbank approval authority over UCAA’s budgeting and planning decisions “exposes UCAA to risk of failure to deliver its mandate, and infringes on State's effective control over UCAA.” After Kakuba’s retirement, the Acting UCAA Director General Fred Bamwesigye wrote to Works Minister Gen Edward Katumba Wamala on September 8, 2021 and reminded him of the importance of renegotiating the loan agreement with China Eximbank. He also asked him to remind Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija to notify China Eximbank of the need to amend the agreement to make it consistent with Ugandan law and international law. He wrote that “whereas some of the provisions referred to were alluded to in the Minutes of the Negotiations, the unfair clauses remain embedded in the agreements, while in some cases, they were not dealt with at all. […] There is, therefore, an urgent need to start the review and renegotiation of the Government Concession Loan Agreement... in order to reduce the intentions of the parties into a legally-binding agreement.” Then, on December 11, 2019, David Kakuba warned Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija that “any seeming delay or any form of understanding that is not reduced into an amended agreement of the signed ones, would maintain the enforceability by [China Eximbank] of the disputed agreement.” He also noted that Section 10.3 of the Repayment Mechanism Agreement provides for a waiver of immunity and states that ‘each obligor hereby irrevocably waives any immunity on grounds of sovereign or other immunity for itself or any of its property in connection with any arbitration proceeding or with enforcement of any arbitral awards any court judgement.' Such a provision, if not amended, David Kakuba argues ""exposes government assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in China.” Around the same time, Uganda’s Ministry of Public Works reportedly asked the Ministry of Finance to seek a speedy revision and resolution of the ‘problematic clauses’ in the China Eximbank loan agreement. However, in December 2021, Bloomberg reported that “Uganda’s chief legal officer urged the Finance Ministry to refrain from renegotiating the terms of [the China Eximbank loan agreement] as it is able to meet its debt obligations.” 1.

The collateralization arrangement that governs the PBC is described in detail in Article 6.12 of the PBC agreement. The PBC agreement defines the ‘security document’ as ‘each of the agreements and legal documents signed by the relevant parties for the purposes of creating security interests in favor of the Lender and enhancing the credit of the Borrower as stipulated in Article 6.12, including without limitation the On-lending Agreement(s), the Repayment Mechanism Agreement and the Escrow Account Agreement.’ Article 6.12 reads as follows: ‘The borrower undertakes that a Repayment Mechanism will be established for the Project and the repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under this Agreement shall be credit enhanced and secured by the Repayment Mechanism Agreement, Escrow Account Agreement and the following arrangements: (1) After this Agreement has been signed by the Borrower and the Lender, the On-Lending Agreement shall be duly signed by the Borrower and End-User [UCAA], in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. (2) The Repayment Reserve Account and the Sales Collection Account shall be opened and maintained with the Escrow Account Bank and be subject to the escrow arrangement under the the Escrow Account Agreement. The Repayment Reserve Account shall be used to maintain the minimum amount of balance as a debt service reserve as required by the Lender and the Lender shall be entitled to utilized the funds in the Repayment Reserve Account. The Sales Collection Account shall be used to collect the revenues of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) and the required amount of funds in the Sales Collection Account shall be transferred to the Repayment Reserve Account as required by the Lender. (3) All the revenues (proceeds) of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable under this Agreement. (4) The Borrower undertakes to ensure that the successors or permitted assignees and transferee of the parties of the Security Documents shall abide by the provisions of the relevant Security Documents. (5) Notwithstanding the existence of the Security Document, the Borrower shall be fully liable for the payment and repayment obligations under this Agreement. The Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement shall not be affected or undermined by the execution, delivery and performance by the relevant parties of such Security Documents.’ The PBC defines the ‘End-User’ as ‘the Civil Aviation Authority of the Republic of Uganda.’ The PBC defines ‘Escrow Accounts’ as ‘each or both (as the context may require) of the Repayment Reserve Account and the Sales Collection Account.’ The PBC defines the ‘Escrow Account Agreement’ as the ‘escrow account agreement entered into to or to be entered into among the Lender, the Borrower, the End-User and the Escrow Account Bank, and other relevant parties, as agreed by the Borrower and the Lender, in respect of opening, maintenance and control of the Escrow Accounts and in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. The PBC defines the ‘Escrow Account Bank’ as the ‘Export-Import Bank of China and/or such other reputable international bank registered in Uganda and acceptable to the lender.’ The PBC defines the ‘On-Lending Agreement(s)’ as the ‘loan agreement entered into between the Borrower and the End-User, whereby the Facility is on-lent by the Borrower to the End-User to implement the Project.’ The PBC defines the ‘Repayment Reserve Account’ as ‘the account in the name of the Borrower with the Escrow Account Bank and for the purpose of maintaining the minimum amount of the funds as debt service reserve pursuant to the Escrow Account Agreement.’ The PBC defines the ‘Repayment Mechanism Agreement’ as ‘the repayment mechanism agreement entered into or to be entered into among the Lender, the Borrower, the End-User n form and substance acceptable to the Lender, under which the parties agree to, among others, enter into (or procure the relevant parties to enter into) the Escrow Account Agreement and ensure all revenues of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to the revenues generated from the Project) shall be paid into the Sales Collection Account.’ The PBC defines the ‘Sales Collection Account’ as ‘the account in the name of End-User with the Escrow Account Bank and for the purpose of collecting revenues of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) pursuant to the Escrow Account Agreement.’ 3. The revenues generated by this project flow through a ‘cashflow waterfall’ arrangement (usefully described via https://pivotal180.com/project-finance-cash-flow-waterfall/ and https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=26f2629e-2040-4dda-a6d8-6600e478cf7f). 4. This project is also known Phase I of the Entebbe International Airport Rehabilitation Project and On Uganda Upgrading and Expansion of the Entebbe International Airport Phase I Project.

This loan was originally intended for the 2015-2017 timeframe but was not actually distributed for unspecified reasons. Then, on April 3, 2018 during President Emmerson Mnangawa's visit to China, the two sides signed bilateral cooperation agreements in the fields of economy and technology, agriculture, science and technology, and human resources development. At the time of signing, Zimbabwe was still processing paperwork related to the RMB 33 million transaction from 2015.   This project involved the installation of a supercomputer facility (high-performance computing center) at the University of Zimbabwe. The facility was expected to be used in agriculture, weather forecast, mining, gene technology, and stimulation, and support scientific research in Zimbabwe. The project also involved the training of dozens of Zimbabwean researchers on how to operate the supercomputer.   Inspur Group — China's leading personal computer and server manufacturer — and Dameng were both involved in the implementation of the project.  On February 6, 2015, the project was officially completed and and handed over to the University of Zimbabwe.

A $950 million loan would reportedly be provided for the project. It is unclear if the financier would be China Eximbank or the Bank of China. The loan has a 15 year maturity with 7% interest.  The implementing agency is China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC,中国建筑股份有限公司), and the beneficiary is ZPC (津巴布韦能源公司).  The Chinese project name is 津巴布韦能源PER Lusulu Power600MW煤电厂项目.  The project is planned to start in April 2016 and end in 2019.  PER Lusulu is developing an integrated 350MW supercritical thermal power plant, located in Binga District Matabeleland North Province of Zimbabwe to supply electricity to the Zimbabwe National Grid.  The project is approximately 305km to the north South cross-border Central Transmission Corridor.  ZETDC’s grid impact studies require PER Lusulu to connect to this corridor at the Alaska Substation.  The PER Lusulu Power Company is targeting financial close by Q2 of 2020 and commissioning of the power plant by the end of 2023 and commencing commercial operations by Q1 2024.  The development of the PER Lusulu Power Plant Project will see a substantial investment into the Binga District, generating domestic revenue streams, stimulating regional development, creating employment opportunities and strengthening and diversifying the country’s production and export base.  This large scale project will be developed in 4 phases, starting with a 350MW Ultra-Supercritical integrated power plant, expanding ultimately to a 2100MW power plant in three by 700MW modules.  The Feasibility Study was conducted by Pro-Consult, independently reviewed by ARUP and in association with numerous specialist sub consultants.  The project has entered into an engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) contract with China State Construction Engineering Corporation.    CSCEC are ranked 27th in Fortune 500 and have the balance sheet to bring the required debt finance via Sinosure Buyers Credit Facility with Bank of China.  The Company is targeting a nominal equity IRR of at least 15% from estimated net equity cash flows.  According to the Global Energy Monitor, in December 2019, PER Lusulu's website said the power project ""has made significant progress towards achieving financial close"" with both financial close and construction targeted for H2 2020, and commissioning by H2 2023.

63462,"China Eximbank provides $98.6 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase 2 of TelOne Broadband Expansion Project On December 1, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed a $98,617,482 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project. Then, on April 5, 2016, Zimbabwe’s Parliament ratified the PBC agreement. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of Zimbabwe, in turn, used the proceeds of the PBC to on-lend to TelOne, a state-owned telecommunications company at a 5% interest rate. The ultimate borrower (TelOne) was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of its $116.8 million commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. The remaining 15% was to be directly funded by TelOne. The guarantor of the loan is NetOne (Private) Limited.   The borrower is expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in an escrow account (debt service reserve account) at China Eximbank. The balance of the escrow account was $0 as of December 31, 2016, $4,341,790 as of December 31, 2017, $4,343,991 as of December 31, 2018, ZWL 220,015,319 as of December 31, 2019, ZWL 157,681,155 as of December 31, 2020, ZWL 720,123,439 as of December 31, 2021, and ZWL 1,294,710,690 as of December 31, 2022. In the event that the funds in the escrow account are insufficient to repay the interest and the principal of the loan, the PBC agreement indicates that the extra revenues from an escrow account that was set up for another China Eximbank-financed project (Phase 3 of NetOne Expansion Project, which is captured in Project ID#52620) will be used to settle the TelOne loan.   The borrower is responsible for making 30, equal semiannual repayments between January 21, 2022 and January 21, 2037. The first drawdown (disbursement) took place on March 14, 2017.  Total loan disbursements amounted to $78,630,649 in 2017 and $14,355,910 in 2018. As of September 2019, TelOne reported that the China Eximbank loan (PBC) had almost fully disbursed ($98,495,973 out of $98,617,482). By 2021, the borrower had accumulated arrears. The loan's amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $104,067,388.34 as of 2021.  The purpose of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project is to replace, upgrade, and transform the state-owned company’s transmission backbone call and access network into a modern telecommunications infrastructure providing a wide range of voice data and video services.   TelOne completed the first phase of the project between 2010 and 2013 at a cost of $18.2 million, of which the Government of Zimbabwe contributed $6.2 million and TelOne contributed $12 million from its own resources. Phase 1 supported the following routes: Harare-Mutare Fibre Optic Transmission, Harare-Bulawayo Optic Transmission and installation of the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Internet Protocol Microwave Radio Link.   Phase 2, which was supported by China Eximbank, focused on the following project components: capacity upgrades in Mashonaland Central and West Provinces; the Bulawayo-Beitbridge Fibre Optic Transmission Route; the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Fibre Optic Transmission Route; the Gweru-Masvingo Fibre Optic Transmission Route; and the supply, installation and commissioning of internet protocol multi-media systems access and converged billing system. Huawei Technologies was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 2 of this project commenced on or around February 1, 2017. Then, on October 10, 2017, TelOne announced the completion of the laying of 330 km of fiber optic cable. On March 13, 2019, Zimbabwean President E.D. Mnangagwa officially commissioned the TelOne Beitbridge-Masvingo-Harare Optic Fibre Link (a sub-project under Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project). As of September 2019, TelOne reported that it had completed Phase 2. The completion of this project reportedly achieved a better billing system, faster internet speed, improved voice call quality, and better performance of TelOne’s toll free and interactive voice response services.   However, there are signs that the China Eximbank loan contracted by the TelOne for the Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project has underperformed financially. According to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was in arrears at the end of 2021.  By the end of 2021, the Government of Zimbabwe's total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G.

HESCO is expected to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC.    The total cost of the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project is $2.148 billion and it is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Standard Bank (unknown amount) and AfreximBank ($176 million) are the other sources of debt financing. 85% of the cost of HESCO’s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro will be covered by the China Eximbank PBC. The remaining 15% ($176 million) will be provided through an equity contribution from Sinohydro. The purpose of the project is to construct Unit 7 and Unit 8 at the Hwange Makomo Power Station, and thereby increase the power generation capacity of the Hwange Makomo Power Station from 600 MW to 1200 MW (through the addition of two power generation units). Hwange Makomo Power Station is a coal-fired power plant and the 14th largest thermal station in the Southern African region. It is adjacent to the Wankie Colliery Open Cast Mine.   The station was built in two stages. The first four power generation (4x120 MW) units were commissioned between 1983 and 1986 and the fifth and sixth power generation (2x220 MW) units were commissioned in 1986 and 1987. These six units are already functional and the station currently generates about 40% percent of the country’s electricity needs. Coal is delivered to the station by an overland conveyor belt which is 6 kilometers long from Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL) as well as by trucks from Makomo and Coalbrick mines. Water that is piped 44 kilometers from the Zambezi River is pumped into two 150,000-cubic-meter reservoirs next to the station and conveyed by gravity to its point of use. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has hired 2532 employees (620 Chinese workers and 1912 local workers) as well as 252 sub-contractor employees (including 217 local workers). After the PBC agreement with China Eximbank was signed on December 1, 2015, the lender demanded that the Government of Zimbabwe meet several conditions, including parliamentary ratification of the PBC; the establishment of a debt service reserve agreement (DSRA) between the Government of Zimbabwe, China Eximbank and HESCO; the establishment of a PPA between HESCO and Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC); the establishment of an agreement between Government of Zimbabwe and HESCO outlining the incentives for the project (in terms of taxation) and guaranteeing ZETDC’s payments to HESCO; the signing of a coal supply agreement between HESCO and Makomo Resources, and the signing of a limestone supply agreement between HESCO and PPC (Zimbabwe). These requirements led to project implementation delays.    The first loan disbursement from China Eximbank took place in June 2018, which paved the way for project commencement on August 1, 2018. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 42 months (February 1, 2022). A formal groundbreaking ceremony was organized on June 27, 2018. Then, on March 1, 2019, a foundation stone laying ceremony took place. As of November 2019, the project had achieved a 25% completion rate. Then, in September 2020, reports emerged that the borrower had failed to comply with the terms of its escrow account agreement with China Eximbank and it instead issued a savings bond as collateral (security) in favor of the lender. By February 2021, the project was running behind schedule; it had achieved a 58.29% completion rate (against a target completion rate of 78.5%). The delay was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and unpaid invoices (IPC payments). As of April 2022, Forbes Chanakira, a project manager for the Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion, reported that the project had achieved an 84.2% completion (progress) rate. He reported that the turbines and generator sets for Unit 7 had been constructed and were awaiting commissioning. At that time, the boiler was about 93% complete and the coal stockyard was expected to be operational in May 2022. The boiler’s control system, the Distributed Control System (DCS), had also been activated. Hot commissioning, a process in which coal is used in the boiler to heat steam, was expected at the time to begin by July 2022. It was expected to last until November 2022 when the unit would be handed off.    Forbes Chanakira also stated in April 2022 that about 810 of the 875 transmission towers built between Hwange and Bulawayo had been placed. At the time, on the 368 km section between Hwange and Bulawayo, a new 400KV line — that would run parallel to the current lines — still needed to be built. The route had been separated into three sections: Bulawayo to Lupane, Lupane to Gwayi, and Gwayi to Hwange, where engineers were working on building towers alongside other construction work. At one point, this project had employed 450 people, but the project ultimately is expected to employ more than 3,000 people. 1. This project is also known as the Hwange 7 & 8 Thermal Power Station Expansion Project. The Chinese project title is 万吉火电站扩容项目. 2. There is some evidence that supplemental funding may have been secured by Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCO) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — in 2018 for the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project.

Its other borrowing terms (interest rate, grace period, fees) are unknown.    A statement about the loan, posted on Sonangol's website, announced that construction of the country's long-planned second refinery at Lobito would begin in 2015. Sonangol had been under pressure for a long time to build a new refinery as it heavily depends on imports for its fuel requirements. However,  construction of the Lobito refinery was frozen in 2016 due to high costs. Then, in 2021, Joaquim de Sousa Fernandes, chairman of the executive council of Sonaref (a subsidiary of Sonangol), announced that the project was being revived and the construction of the Lobito refinery was scheduled for completion in 2025. 1. Sonangol's 2016 and 2018 Annual Report stated that all outstanding loans have an interest rate of 3.5% + LIBOR; however, it is unclear if this represents the interest rate for this particular loan.

66806,"CDB extends $2.5 billion master facility agreement to Angola in May 2014 On May 9, 2014, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $2.5 billion master facility agreement with the Government of Angola.   The agreement is a master agreement under which the Government of Angola and CDB may conclude individual loan agreements (ILAs) for the purpose of financing up to 85% of the contract price owing to certain approved contractors in respect of certain approved infrastructure projects in Angola, primarily in the areas of housing, transportation, agriculture, roads and railways, hospitals, schools, telecommunication, water and electricity, sanitation and other human livelihood areas agreed by CDB and Angola. Each individual (subsidiary) loan approved through the facility must be for a minimum of $10 million and have a maturity of 10 years.   As of December 31, 2017, $2,199,500,000 was drawn down under the MLFA. The (principal) amount outstanding under the MLFA was $300.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The availability period for drawdowns under this master facility agreement ended on May 9, 2017. However, it was later extended until 2021.   Projects that may have been funded through the master facility agreement include: 1. Construction of access roads to Luanda International Airport (Project ID#65307) 2. Rehabilitation of New Luanda International Airport (Project ID#72349)  There are indications that the May 2014 CDB loan financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015. The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25. The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023. 1. This project is not categorized as an umbrella record because the full amount of the facility was disbursed. However, AidData was not able to identify all of the subsidiary loans and the face values of all subsidiary loans approved through this facility. Therefore, to eliminate the risk of double counting, AidData does not record transaction amounts for the subsidiary loans. Instead, it records the amount that the borrower drew down ($2,199,500,000) from this facility.2. According to China Development Bank's website, it provided Angola's Ministry of Finance with a $4 billion ‘sovereign loan’, which is a specific type of loan that only CDB issues (Chinese name: 主权类外汇贷款). It is likely that this $2.5 billion credit line (MLFA) is part of the $4 billion sovereign loan that is referenced. The remaining $1.5 billion is likely captured via Project ID#67.3. Given that CDB agreed to issue individual loans to finance up to 85% of the cost of commercial contracts, AidData assumes that these individual loans were issued in the form of buyer's credits. This issue warrants further investigation. 4. The loan's interest rate and grace period are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the interest rate (3.7873%) and grace period (1.9008 years) identified in the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) for official sector Chinese lending to Angola in 2014.

46436,"China Eximbank provides $385.8 million preferential buyer's credit for Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project  On May 16, 2014, China Eximbank signed a $385,808,808.60 in preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 6 TOTAL NO. (300)] with Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.25%, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 20 years. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($453,892,716.00) of a commercial contract between the Steering and Monitoring Committee of the Kribi Industrial and Port Complex of Cameroon and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., which was signed on November 28, 2012. The remaining 15% was to be covered by the Government of Cameroon's MINEPAT.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 80.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 40.1 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Edéa-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Edéa-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government’s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’ 1.

According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank made 15 loan disbursements (worth CFA 459,375,056,353) between 2015 and 2020: a CFA 71,405,100,000 disbursement on September 30, 2015, a CFA 48,843,381,789 disbursement on April 30, 2016, a CFA 5,293,017,891 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a CFA 8,388,694,167 disbursement on October 31, 2016, a CFA 3,281,002,542 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a CFA 50,318,912,478 disbursement on December 31, 2016, a CFA 60,326,378,065 disbursement on December 31, 2017, a CFA 75,857,838,185 disbursement on October 31, 2018, a CFA 24,960,426,152 disbursement on May 31, 2019, a CFA 6,247,765,605 disbursement on September 30, 2019, a CFA 17,886,499,596 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a CFA 12,392,163,528 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 7,423,281,737 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a CFA 5,517,839,600 disbursement on April 30, 2010, and a CFA 61,232,755,018 disbursement on June 30, 2020.  The project involved the enlargement of the Vridi canal (a link from Abidjan to the Atlantic Ocean), the construction of a second container terminal, and a roll-on/roll-off terminal. It was expected to start in the first quarter of 2015 and reach completion by 2021.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2015. The roll-on/roll-off terminal was finished at some point in 2018. On February 21, 2019, the enlargement of Vridi Canal was officially completed and handed over to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. The project as a whole was officially completed on April 23, 2020, and a certificate of final acceptance was issued by the project owner in July 2021. However, the construction of the second container terminal was not completed until November 25, 2022. The modern container terminal, roll-on/roll-off terminal, jetties, and approach channels that were expanded and improved with financing from China Eximbank have reportedly increased the cargo handling capacity and efficiency of the port.  This project suffered from major cash flow problems. According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), PAA had payment arrears to CHEC worth CFA 186 billion (China Eximbank share: CFA 165 billion; PAA share: CFA 21 billion) as of November 14, 2017. The AMP also notes that, as of November 14, 2017, the project was generating large financial outflows but it was not expected to generate revenue until 2020. To increase PAA’s revenue-generation capacity, the Ivorian authorities considered putting in place a special tax and customs regime (in accordance with Articles 4 and 43 of the PAA statutes) from 2020 to 2035. It is unclear if they ultimately did so. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire and PAA also secured an EUR 10,641,840 agreement with Matha Capital, JP Morgan, Société Générale Paris, and Ecobank to hedge its foreign exchange (USD/CFA) risk on its outstanding debt to China Eximbank for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project. 1.

This loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 25-year maturity, a 15-year grace-period, a 0% interest rate, and a 0% default (penalty) interest rate. It is scheduled for repayment between December 1, 2029 and November 30, 2039. In addition to this loan, this stadium project was financed by an additional grant and interest-free loan from the Chinese Government:   (1) a CFA 11.9 billion grant provided in March 2017 (captured via Project ID#85370), and  (2) a CFA 20.69 million interest-free loan issued on February 22, 2016 (captured via Project ID#73441).   The loan and grant proceeds were to be used to finance an RMB 750,000,000 (CFA 63,990,243,240) commercial contract [ID#2016-0-2-1417/02-29 between Ivorian Government and Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG), which was signed on July 22, 2016. The Ivorian Government was responsible for providing CFA 4 billion of counterpart financing for earthworks and the installation of water, electrical and telecommunications infrastructure at the project site.   This project involved the construction of a 60,012 seat stadium in Ebimpé within the Anyama sub-prefecture. It also involved the construction of an Olympic village surrounding the stadium, which has 4 housing estates, a training complex, administrative buildings, a commercial area, a clinic, a 4-star hotel, a 9-hole golf course, and of a medium voltage power line (15 kV) dedicated to the stadium (from the Yopougon 2 HV/MV transformer station to the industrial zone). Additionally, it involved the construction of a 10,000 seat multi-purpose arena.   Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG) was the contractor responsible for implementation. It hired approximately 1000 workers, of which 350 were Chinese and 650 were Ivorian. Project implementation commenced on December 10, 2016. Then, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 22, 2016 (originally planned for January 2016). Shortly thereafter, on December 31, 2016, the Chinese Government made a loan disbursement worth CFA 14 billion. An electrical connection for the project site was established on August 18, 2017.  Foundation pile construction was completed on September 26, 2017. Construction was expected to last 24 months and project was originally expected to reach completion on October 21, 2019. When the Ivorian Minister of Sports inspected the construction site in August 2018, the project had achieved a 50% completion rate and its expected completion (delivery) date had been pushed back to November 21, 2019.  An opening ceremony for the stadium took place on October 3, 2020. It was completed in advance of the the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations football (soccer) tournament. According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the project encountered several problems during implementation, including ‘bad behavior’ among Chinese team leaders towards the workers on the project site, a lack of protective equipment for workers, a worker strike on October 23, 2017 for better wages and improved working conditions, and non-compliance with the contractual deadlines for the execution of the project. 1.

According to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), 103% of the face value of the China Eximbank loan (CFA 53,933,704,720 of CFA 51,603,595,065.93) had been disbursed as of October 31, 2017. 11 China Eximbank loan disbursements were made: a CFA 4,849,072,000 disbursement on June 30, 2015, a CFA 9,698,144,000 disbursement on August 18, 2015, a CFA 7,218,470,000 disbursement on August 28, 2015, a CFA 2,545,790,800 disbursement on January 31, 2017, a CFA 3,896,015,200 disbursement on May 31, 2016, a CFA 4,789,960,000 disbursement on July 31, 2016 a CFA 4,878,076,000 disbursement on August 31, 2016, a CFA 5,795.599,600 disbursement on September 14, 2016, a CFA 5,795,626,495 disbursement on February 28, 2017, a CFA 3,924,058,625 disbursement on April 30, 2017, and a CFA 542,892,000 disbursement on October 31, 2017. The Ivorian Government also agreed to provide counterpart financing of CFA 985,040000, but ultimately only disbursed CFA 692,986,703.  This project involved the installation of water pump stations and other infrastructure to distribute water from South Comoé groundwater table in Bonoua to the southern zone of the capital city of Abidjan (in particular, the island of Petit Bassam, which includes the municipalities of Marcory, Koumassi, Treichville and Port-Bouët). More specifically, it involved the construction and equipping of a water treatment station in Bonoua (4000 m3/h); the construction and equipping of a recovery or overpressure station in Moossou; the construction and equipping of a recovery station in Port Bouet; facilitating the transfer of raw water from the catchment fields of Ono (7 boreholes) and Abrobakro (11 boreholes) to the Bonoua treatment plant; and facilitating the transfer of treated water from the Bonoua treatment plant to the Port Bouet pick-up station. The island of Petit Bassam, despite its hydraulic infrastructure, has been plagued by drinking water supply difficulties since the 2000s. This project sought to put an end to these recurring water shortages.   China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC) was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. An official groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 2, 2015 but construction itself did not begin until March 4, 2015. The project encountered difficulties in October 2016 with electrical connections for the boreholes of the Abrobakro catchment field. Two months later, in December 2016, construction was suspended for 15 days due to a failure by the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to pay CFA 5 billion of compensation to displaced households. However, by October 31, 2017, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate and a 95% financial execution rate. Then, on July 12, 2018, the project passed trials and inspections and it was officially handed over to the Ivorian authorities. The project’s originally scheduled project commencement and completion dates (as specified in the commercial contract) were January 2, 2016 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The project is now managed by the National Water Fund, an Ivorian state-owned company.

The Ethiopian the House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under Proclamation no. 854/2014 on June 24, 2014. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 6 year grace period, and a maturity of 20 years.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $216,530,065.53 (ETB 3,986,318,506.35) commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Geo-engineering Construction Overseas Company Group (CGCOC), which was signed on March 5, 2013. The ERA was responsible for directly funding 15% (ETB 597,947,775.95 or $32,479,509.829) of the commercial contract cost.

The purpose of the project was to construct a 220 km toll road from Dire Dawa (Diredawa) to Dewalle (Dawale). The road was constructed according to the following standard: 7 meters wide and 5 cm thick single layer of asphalt concrete, with 2 by 1.5m at the highway shoulder. CGCOC was the general EPC contract responsible for project implementation. Shandong Great Supervision and Consultation Co., Ltd. provided the consulting services for the project. The project commenced in October 2014. It was completed in December 2018. The road was officially inaugurated on June 18, 2019.   Upon completion, the toll road was officially transferred to the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprises. The completion of the project has reportedly reduced the travel time from Dire Dawa city to the Djibouti border from 10 hours to 4 hours. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[t]hus far, there is not much traffic on the road, which leads through the desert and has almost no services or other urban settlements along it. This highway could become financially viable by providing a faster link between Addis Ababa and Djibouti, but only when the missing sections between AdamaAwash-Mieso-Dire Dawa are built. While the AfDB and the WB are preparing financing for some of these missing sections, Chinese financing of the Dire Dawa-Dewele section was premature.’ To access the toll road, truck drivers are required to pay ETB 200 ($7); mid-size trucks are required to pay ETB 150; and automobile drivers are required to pay ETB 100. As of late 2021, there was no data available on the amount of toll revenue generated by the road.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Dire Dawa-Dewalle Toll Road Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension).

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $500 million (ETB 9,727,626,459) loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project achieved a 114% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 44 loan disbursements (worth ETB 11,118,858,284) between 2015 and 2020: an ETB 554,010,424 disbursement on December 25, 2015, an ETB 1,786,218,847 disbursement on May 18, 2016, an ETB 448,903,299 disbursement on December 23, 2016, an ETB 28,238,854 disbursement on December 23, 2016, an ETB 124,292,734 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 138,110,858 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 35,899,704 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 92,355,665 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 296,084,581 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 242,822,856 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 26,193,982 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 20,337,902 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 164,283,295 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 271,695,163 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 106,574,404 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 278,058,734 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 355,556,821 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 331,393,450 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 19,022,653 disbursement on October 20, 2017, an ETB 216,925,077 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 443,315,855 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 398,505,561 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 198,158,894 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 88,128,548 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 384,778,609 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 114,884,096 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 755,478,704 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 424,036,093 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 141,070,367 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 186,832,817 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 198,158,894 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 114,884,096 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 399,053,780 disbursement on November 1, 2018, an ETB 98,778,655 disbursement on November 1, 2018, an ETB 255,406,833 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 207,818,195 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 120,484,148 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 498,639,680 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 199,168,958 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 125,539,899 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 69,558,427 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 131,099,561 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 12,440,636 disbursement on October 22, 2010, and an ETB 15,657,678 disbursement on October 22, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to construct a sugar mill, construct a 135.5 meter-high and 840 meter-wide ‘May-Day’ irrigation dam on the Zarema River (next to the Waldiba Monastery) with the capacity to hold 3.5 billion cubic meters of water, install irrigation equipment, and construct a 4x30MW biogas power station (cogeneration power plant). About 70% of the electricity generated from the biogas power station (also known as the bagasse-fired power plant) will be used to run the sugar mill and 30% will connect to the surrounding area through a 137 kV electricity transmission line. The sugar mill (plant) will use sugarcane planted on 40,000 hectares of land and get irrigation water from the Tekeze, Kalema and Zarema rivers. Once it is fully operational, the sugar mill is expected to crush 24,000 tons of sugarcane per day (tcd), produce 484,000 tons of sugar per year, and produce 41.654 million liters of ethanol per year. The project site is located in Tigray Regional State’s Western Zone in Welkayit District.   CAMCE is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Sur Construction is a subcontractor responsible for undertaking the construction of the irrigation dam. The project is being implemented in two phases (stages) and financed via two different loan tranches. On April 10, 2014, CAMCE signed a project design contract. Then, on October 9, 2016, a project commencement ceremony took place. Then, on March 15, 2019, Abraham Tekster, the Deputy Governor of Tigray, conducted an on-site project inspection. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (October 9, 2019). However, as of December 17, 2019, the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP noted that the ‘[irrigation] dam [was] not completed’ and the ‘field for sugar cane [was] not fully ready [for] production’. As of April 2020, the project had only achieved a 95% completion rate. On November 4, 2020, the Welkait Sugar Mill was damaged in an air raid during the Tigray conflict. The Chinese government ended up evacuating more than 600 of its citizens, including 187 employees from the Welkait Sugar Mill.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. in 2019, Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance announced that it was seeking to privatize the Welkait Sugar Mill (as part of a broader effort to address the government’s debt sustainability problems and the ESC’s inability to fund the ongoing operations of multiple, faltering sugar factories). Also, according to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.  1. This project is also known as the Walkait Sugar Factory Project, the Wolkaiyt Sugar Development Project, the Ethiopia Welkait 24,000TCD Sugar Cane Factory Project, the Welkayt Sugar Factory Project, and the Welkait 1 and Welkait 2 Sugar Factory Project. The Chinese project title is 瓦尔凯特糖厂项目. 2. The all-in interest rate (3.323%) was estimated by adding a 3% margin to average 6-Month LIBOR in May 2014 (0.323%). 3. The AMP system identification number for this loan/project is 87143359124089. 4. 1 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) was equal to 0.051 U.S. dollars (USD) in May 2014. 5. AidData relies upon the borrowing terms (6-month LIBOR plus as 3% margin, a 14 year maturity, and 4 year grace period) that are recorded in the Public Sector Debt Statistical Bulletin No. 13 published by Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance. SAIS-CARI reports a different set of borrowing terms (6-month LIBOR plus as 2.6% margin, a 12 year maturity, and 2 year grace period). 6. The AMP records a second loan (master loan facility) worth ETB 8,547,008,547 for the ‘Walkait Sugar Factory’ (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/bwyofmr1valdi9i/Master%20Loan%20Facility%20for%20Walkait%20Sugar%20Factory.pdf?dl=0). The AMP identifies the commitment date of the loan as August 14, 2011 and it records 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 6,650,420,383) between 2016 and 2020. The AMP system identification number for this loan/project is 87143436113936. More research is needed to determine why the AMP appears to contain two separate loan records for the same project.",True,0.84214383

31777,"China Eximbank provides $1.6 billon preferential buyer's credit for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#37103, #47025) On June 26, 2012, Kenya Railway Corporation (KRC) approved a feasibility study and preliminary project design from China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). Then, on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012, KRC and CRBC signed two commercial (EPC) contracts worth $3,804,192,784.92: (1) a $2,657,401,776.17 Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract on July 11, 2012 and (2) a $1,146,791,008.75 Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract on October 4, 2012. In August 2012, the Kenyan Cabinet approved the development of the railway, which was followed by the signing of a bilateral agreement by the Kenyan and Ugandan governments for the construction of the railway (that was later upgraded to a tripartite agreement with the Rwandan government). Less than a year later, in July 2013, the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya and China Eximbank signed an MOU — that was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Kenya — based on the commercial (EPC) contracts that CRBC and KRC signed on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. On May 11, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed two loan agreements worth $3.604 billion for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Kenya Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project). The first loan was a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Contract No. 1410302052014210766] worth $2,003,584,028.87 and it was provided on the following terms: a 5.25 year grace period, a 5 year (60 month) disbursement period, a 15.25 year maturity, an interest rate of 6-month Libor plus 3.6% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, a 0.75% ($15,026,880.22) management fee, a 6.93% insurance premium (payable in three installments), and a 1% default interest rate. The face value of the BCL was subsequently revised to $1,903,404,827.42. The BCL is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $211,543,142.85. The second loan was a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 13 TOTAL NO. (307) NO. (1420303052014210788)] worth $1,600,000,000 and it was provided on the following terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7.25 year grace period, a 7 year (84 month) availability period, a 20.25 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($4,000,000) management fee. The BCL was scheduled for 20 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2019 and July 21, 2029. The PBC was scheduled for 26 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2021 and July 21, 2034. The Government of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL (captured via captured via Project ID#37103) and the PBC (captured via Project ID#31777) to the ‘end-user’ (KRC). The ultimate borrower (KRC) was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL and PBC to to finance 90% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts that it signed with CRBC on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. More specifically, the proceeds from the PBC were to be used to finance 42.06% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts and be exclusively utilized to make payment for the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract). The proceeds from the BCL were to be used to finance (a) 31.95% of the total cost ($849,000,000 out of $2,657,401,776.17) of the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract), (b) 85% of the total cost ($974,772,357.44 out of $1,146,791,008.75) of the Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract, and (c) 85% of the total cost ($179,811,671,43 out of $211,543,142.85) of the medium-long term buyer’s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 10% was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing, of which not less than $380,420,427.8 was to be applied to the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract. In order to facilitate repayment of its debts to China Eximbank, the Kenyan Government provided an assurance to the lender that it would guarantee a minimum amount of railway freight through the execution of a take-or-pay agreement between KRC and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The KPA also agreed to levy a new, 1.5% tax on imported goods (called the ‘Railway Development Levy’). The Railway Development Levy was designed to serve as insurance in case the revenues generated through the take-or-pay arrangement fall short of the amount required to service the China Eximbank loans. The borrower also expected to use to the Railway Development Levy to finance the Kenyan government’s portion (15%) of the project (commercial contract) cost.    The BCL and PBC are secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues that are deposited into a revenue account (escrow account) and a minimum cash balance in a payment account (escrow account). A 2014 Escrow Account Agreement between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the Government of Kenya, and China Eximbank specifies that ‘KRC shall ensure that the following minimum amounts in [U.S.] Dollars [USD] shall be held in the Payment Account, so long as an Secured Obligations under the Loan [PBC and BCL] Agreement remain outstanding: (i) when the Loans are within the applicable Grace Period, no less than US$84,000,000, which shall be deposited into the Payment Account in the following installments: 1) an amount, of US$16,800,000, shall be deposited into the Payment Account before the first disbursement, 2) an amount of US$16,800,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before January 15, 2015, 3) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2015, 4) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2016; (ii) when any Loan [PBC or BCL] is within its Repayment Period, no less than US$250,000,000, and (iii) when the [BCL is] fully repaid, no less than US$80,000,000.' If the borrower does not adhere to its loan repayment schedule (runs arrears), the escrow account bank is responsible for withdrawing funds the overdue payment amount (plus 1% penalty interest) from the payment account and remitting payment to China Eximbank; then, the escrow account bank reimburses/replenishes the payment account with funds from the revenue account (where project revenues are deposited).  According to the audited financial statements of KRC, the cash balances in the escrow accounts were as follows: KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2014, KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2015, KES 5,981,587,210 (USD 59,217,713.37)  in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 2,708 (USD 26.80) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2016, KES 8,713,702,264 (USD 85,394,282.18) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 72,472,503 (USD 702,983) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2017, KES 8,912,943,504 (USD 88,238,140.68) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 424,026,583 (USD 4,197,863.17) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,412,855,396 (USD 13,987,268.42) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2018, KES 9,078,451,382 (USD 88,968,823.54) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 5,334,370,360 (USD 52,276,829.52) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,567,057,226 (USD 15,357,160.81) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2019, and KES 9,195,200,216 (USD 86,434,882.03) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 18,447,296,513 (USD 173,404,587.22) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 2,991,272,808 (USD 28,117,964.39) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2020. Given that the BCL was still in its grace period until August 11, 2019 and the Preferential Buyer’s Credit (PBC) was still in its grace period until August 11, 2021, the borrower evidently complied with the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 84 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while the BCL and PBC were still in their grace periods and the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 250 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while either loan was in its repayment period (as specified in the Escrow Account Agreement).  The borrower made principal repayments on the BCL worth $100,179,201.44 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $200,358,402.88 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The BCL’s amount outstanding was $1,903,404,827.42 as of June 30, 2020, $1,703,046,424.53 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,502,688,021.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The borrower made no principal repayments on the PBC between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and principal repayments worth $61,538,461.54 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The PBC’s amount outstanding was $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,538,461,538.46 as of June 30, 2022.  The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) is the largest infrastructure project constructed in Kenya since independence in 1963. The Kenyan Government and the Ugandan Government first promoted the idea of the SGR in 2008 as part of a Northern Corridor Initiative to link the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa to the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes Region. In August 2009, Kenya’s Ministry of Transport (MoT) and CRBC signed a memorandum of understanding, whereby CRBC agreed to undertake a feasibility study of the SGR Project at no cost to Kenya’s MoT.     In January 2011, CRBC submitted a feasibility report to Kenya’s MoT, which concluded that Phase 1 of the railway’s expected economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was of 14.66%, which was higher than the Government of Kenya’s ‘hurdle rate’ of 12%. However, the CRBC feasibility study later became a source of controversy. Its central conclusion — that the SGR was economically feasible — was inconsistent with the conclusions of previous studies undertaken by the World Bank and a Canadian consultancy firm. The CRBC feasibility study also included no cash flow projections. It asserted that the project would be highly profitable, but its estimates of the net present value (NPV) of the project’s expected economic benefits varied between $2 billion and $2.6 billion. The fact that the project’s estimated economic benefits were lower than its expected costs aroused suspicion about the credibility of the 14.66% EIRR estimate. The Government of Kenya’s decision to only allow CRBC to conduct the project’s feasibility study was also challenged by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), which argued that Kenyan laws require competitive bidding for a feasibility study. However, a Kenyan court ruled in favor of the government, and stated that the whole procurement process was legal. After the award of tender for the whole project was issued without competitive bidding, sub-tenders did not follow competitive bidding processes. Two Kenyan parliamentary committees, learning of this lack of competitive bidding, recommended cancellation of the sub-tenders, but they were ignored by President Kenyatta. Then, in 2020, a Kenyan court of appeal ruled that the SGR contract issued to CRBC was illegal because it was issued in a manner that is inconsistent Kenya’s procurement laws. The court ruled that the contract should be made public, but a Kenyan MoT official said that making the contract public would undermine national security.     The purpose of the project was to construct a 485 km railway from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then onward to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. Upon completion, the railway was expected have a total track length of 609 km. The project sought to transport passengers and cargo from Nairobi to the southeastern port city of Mombasa at 120 kilometers per hour, thus reducing travel time between Nairobi and Mombasa from more than 10 hours to more than 4 hours. The project was also expected to reduce travel times and transport costs by as much as 60 percent. If properly implemented, the Kenyan Government estimated that the railway would increase the country’s annual rate of economic growth by 1.5 percentage points.   China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation, and Kenya Railway Corporation (KR) supervised its work. Project implementation commenced on December 12, 2014. The project reached completion on May 31, 2017, eighteen months ahead of schedule. President Kenyatta scheduled the completion ceremony just two months before voters would go to the polls and on Madaraka Day—a national holiday that commemorates the day when colonial Britain granted Kenya the right to internal self-rule. At the project completion ceremony, President Kenyatta gave a speech and said that ‘[our] history … was first started 122 years ago when the British, who had colonised this nation, kicked off the train to nowhere ... it was then dubbed the ‘Lunatic Express’. Today... despite again a lot of criticism we now celebrate not the ‘Lunatic Express’ but the Madaraka Express that will begin to reshape the story of Kenya for the next 100 years.’ However, the project has become a source of local scrutiny and controversy. In December 2018, a letter from Kenya’s Auditor General to the Kenya Ports Authority was leaked to the media. It suggested that the Port of Mombasa’s assets were sources of collateral that could be seized in the event that the Kenyan government could not repay its loans to China Eximbank. The letter also suggested that the Kenyan government had waived its sovereign immunity rights in order to make this pledge of collateral. The possibility that Beijing would seize a strategic asset like the Port of Mombasa provokes a public outcry in Kenya. President Kenyatta dismissed the criticism that the Kenyan government had mortgaged the Port of Mombasa to Beijing as ‘pure propaganda.’ He told a group of journalists that ‘if you want a copy of the [SGR loan] contract we have with China I can get it to you tomorrow. […]’. But neither the BCL contract nor the PBC contract was made public. In 2018, the SGR project also became a target of an anti-corruption drive by Kenya's Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP). According to Reuters, the “Kenyan authorities […] arrested the head of the agency that manages public land and the boss of the state railway on suspicion of corruption over land allocation for the new $3-billion flagship Nairobi-Mombasa railway. […] Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri, the chairman of National Land Commission, was one of 18 officials, businesspeople and companies named in a statement listing arrests that was posted …on the prosecutor’s office’s Twitter feed. Also arrested was Atanas Kariuki Maina, managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation. […] The investigation that led to the arrests centers on allegations that officials siphoned taxpayer money through [fraudulent] compensation claims for land used for the railway.’    John Githongo, a former anti-corruption czar in Kenya, told a newspaper in August 2022 that ‘[t]he standard gauge railway is the jewel in the crown of corruption in Kenya.’ The secrecy surrounding the China Eximbank loan contracts that were issued for the SGR Project has also become a source of local concern. The Kenyan government has declined to make public the loan contracts in response to a court petition by two activists (Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo), saying they have non-disclosure clauses and that releasing them would amount to breaching a bilateral agreement, thereby impairing relations between the Kenyan government and the Chinese Government. According to an affidavit from Kenya’s Public Works Principal Secretary Solomon Kitungu, releasing the loan contracts would undermine Kenya’s national security ‘since [the] terms in the contract[s] touch on foreign government information with implications on national security and foreign relations.’ Two activists—Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo—filed a petition in 2021 at the High Court in Mombasa seeking to obtain all contracts, agreements, and studies for the construction and operation of the SGR. Through a coalition called Okoa Mombasa, Khalifa had previously attempted and failed to get the documents through Kenya’s Access to Information Act after the Kenyan government directed that all containerized cargo at the Port of Mombasa be transported inland through the SGR. This move reportedly had negative impact on the Kenyan coast’s port-based economy because it forced logistics companies to move their operations to container depots in the country’s interior. ‘We have a right to know the details of the project: how our money is being spent, the consequences of a loan default, and the government’s decision-making processes in signing the deal. Right now, we know none of this—the Kenyan public is completely in the dark,’ said Khalifa. Gikonyo, his co-petitioner, is the national coordinator for The Institute for Social Accountability, a Nairobi-based civil society organization.    Yet another concern about the project is related to its revenue performance. It was originally projected that the railway would move 22 million tons of cargo a year. However, a Government of Kenya assessment later revealed that the maximum amount of cargo that the railway could move was approximately 8.7 million tons of cargo a year. Also, one year after the SGR was put into operation, a parliamentary report showed that it cost more than double the amount to transport goods on the train than on the road. To make the railway profitable, the Kenyan authorities compelled importers to send cargo by railway instead of by road. This decision set off protests, riots, and court cases in October 2019 and November 2019. Then, on On December 4, 2019. Kenya’s senate committee on transport summoned the Kenyan cabinet secretary for transport over his directive to haul cargo from the port city of Mombasa to Nairobi exclusively by rail. The meeting — attended by activists, businessmen and leaders from Mombasa — ended with the cabinet secretary, James Macharia, promising to rescind the directive, which had reportedly hurt local businesses. Then, in September 2020  Kenyan lawmakers tabled a report in parliament recommending that the government renegotiate the terms of the China Eximbank loans for the SGR ‘due to the prevailing economic distress occasioned by the effects of Covid 19’. In the same report, the lawmakers recommend that the government renegotiate the SGR operation agreement, ‘by planning to reduce operation costs by at least 50%’. The SGR operators had to halt its passenger service for nearly three months due to concerns about the potential spread of the pandemic. CRBC operates the railway’s passenger and cargo service through its subsidiary, the Africa Star Railway Operation Company. In the three years the SGR has been in operation, Africa Star Railway Operation’s expenditure has always exceeded revenue, and the Kenyan taxpayer money has to fill the gap to sustain the company’s operations. A report by Kenya’s transport ministry tabled in parliament in 2018 says the railway made a loss of KES 9.8 billion ($90.3 million) in its first year of operation. At the time, the Kenyan Government projected a profit of $46.8 million for the following year. However, a report by the transport ministry in 2020, also tabled to parliament, said the railway recorded a loss of $200 million over the previous three years. The document also said that during this period, the railway generated revenues of $230.7 million but had operational costs of $430.5 million. The transport ministry cited reduced limited storage capacity at a Nairobi container depot, minimum use of the city’s freight terminal, and railway charges as reasons for this performance, arguably the kinds of details a thorough appraisal should have raised. The SGR operates both passenger and cargo services and while passengers embrace it for reducing travel time compared to buses, cargo owners shun it for reasons including higher fees and tariffs, additional time clearing goods and a lack of last-mile delivery, when compared to trucks. Kenya’s election in August 2022 became a vote on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy of debt-financed infrastructure building, much of it built and financed by China Eximbank. This was especially true for the SGR.    The opposition party candidate Raila Odinga ran on a promise to renegotiate the Kenyan government’s outstanding debts to China Eximbank. Speaking at Chatham House in London on March 16, 2022, he said he would assemble a tough team of negotiators: ‘It depends on how you negotiate with the Chinese. If you don't have negotiators they will of course impose their terms on you.’ Several months later, in June 2022, the ruling party presidential candidate, William Ruto, told Reuters that he would publish government contracts with Chinese companies and renegotiate loans with China Eximbank. Then, in September 2022, newly elected Kenyan President William Ruto reverted cargo clearing services from Nairobi inland container depot (ICD) to the Port of Mombasa. The expected immediate impact of reverting port operations to the Port of Mombasa was a shift to road haulage and a reduction in cargo business for the SGR. Ruto’s predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, moved cargo clearance to the Nairobi ICD to help ease congestion at the Port of Mombasa and boost its competitiveness while also boosting traffic on the SGR to increase revenue for debt repayment. The effect of Ruto’s September 2022 decision was to shift more of the responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans to Kenyan taxpayers.  In mid-October 2022, Kenya’s incoming Transport Secretary, Kipchumba Murkomen also said during his confirmation hearing that he planned to renegotiate the China Eximbank loans for the Standard Gauge Railway Project. He said that these loans were likely repayable over fifty years rather than fifteen to twenty years. He also said that ‘[I]f approved, I will look for the SGR agreement and make it available to the public because no one knows the contents of that agreement’. Then, in November 2022, Kipchumba Murkomen publicly disclosed all three China Eximbank loan agreements for the SGR project.  There are some indications that the SGR loans have underperformed vis-a-vis the lender's original expectations. In July 2022, the Government of Kenya received 'settlement notes' (an overdue repayment notification) from China Eximbank. Then, in October 2022, local media outlets reported (based on confidential Treasury documents) that the Government of Kenya defaulted on its China Eximbank loans for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project. The lender reportedly imposed a fine (‘default interest’ payment) worth $10.8 million (1.312 billion Kenyan shillings).  1. This project is also known as the Development of Mombasa to Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project. The Chinese project title is 蒙内铁路项目.  2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate that applies to the BCL by adding 3.6% to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in May 2014 (0.323%).  3. The PBC agreement and BCL agreement define ‘Long Term Service Agreement’ as ‘any long term service purchase agreement with take-or-pay terms (or similar agreement or arrangement) entered into or to be entered into between the railway operator of the Railway (being the End-User as of the date of this Agreement or any of its legal assigns or successors) and users of the Railway (including without limitation the Kenya Ports Authority), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.’  Under clause 1.4 of the September 30, 2014 take-or-pay agreement (also known as the ‘Delivery and Movement of Freight to the Embakasi Container Depot’ agreement), Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) were required to enter into a Long Term Service Agreement which provides under paragraph(C) of the preamble that ‘the repayment of the principal and payment of the interest and fees of the loans are to be secured, inter alia, by a Long Term Service Agreement with an aim of guaranteeing a minimum amount of freight throughout the term of the agreement to be charged and received by the operator for the project, which shall be used to secure the repayment of principal and interest’. Further, the Long Term Service Agreement between KRC and KPA also provides under clause 7 (c) that “that KPA shall make good any short fall arising either on account of failure to consign the minimum cargo as stipulated in Schedule 1 or to remit the amount of money commensurate with the volume of cargo so consigned and shall pay to Kenya Railways Corporation such an amount as is required to make good the short fall within a period of 30 days following the completion of reconciliation exercise”. In the event of default by Kenya Railways Corporation to pay China Eximbank collected freight and service charges, Kenya Ports Authority would be compelled to deposit the amount due to Kenya Railways Corporation [in a] bank account designated by the China Eximbank.’  4. Under the ‘Take or Pay’ Agreement, KPA undertakes to consign a defined minimum volume of freight to the Embakasi Inland Container Depot to be transported on the Standard Gauge Railway. This agreement will form part of the security package (collateral arrangement) for the loan.  5. On December 5, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $1,397,927,373.27 for Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway Project. This loan is captured via Project ID#47025. 6.

37103,"China Eximbank provides $1.903 billion buyer’s credit loan for Phase 1 of Standard Gauge Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#31777 and #47025) On June 26, 2012, Kenya Railway Corporation (KRC) approved a feasibility study and preliminary project design from China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). Then, on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012, KRC and CRBC signed two commercial (EPC) contracts worth $3,804,192,784.92: (1) a $2,657,401,776.17 Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract on July 11, 2012 and (2) a $1,146,791,008.75 Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract on October 4, 2012. In August 2012, the Kenyan Cabinet approved the development of the railway, which was followed by the signing of a bilateral agreement by the Kenyan and Ugandan governments for the construction of the railway (that was later upgraded to a tripartite agreement with the Rwandan government). Less than a year later, in July 2013, the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya and China Eximbank signed an MOU — that was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Kenya — based on the commercial (EPC) contracts that CRBC and KRC signed on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. On May 11, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed two loan agreements worth $3.604 billion for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Kenya Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project). The first loan was a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Contract No. 1410302052014210766] worth $2,003,584,028.87 and it was provided on the following terms: a 5.25 year grace period, a 5 year (60 month) disbursement period, a 15.25 year maturity, an interest rate of 6-month Libor plus 3.6% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, a 0.75% ($15,026,880.22) management fee, a 6.93% insurance premium (payable in three installments), and a 1% default interest rate. The face value of the BCL was subsequently revised to $1,903,404,827.42. The BCL is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $211,543,142.85. The second loan was a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 13 TOTAL NO. (307) NO. (1420303052014210788)] worth $1,600,000,000 and it was provided on the following terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7.25 year grace period, a 7 year (84 month) availability period, a 20.25 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($4,000,000) management fee. The BCL was scheduled for 20 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2019 and July 21, 2029. The PBC was scheduled for 26 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2021 and July 21, 2034. The Government of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL (captured via captured via Project ID#37103) and the PBC (captured via Project ID#31777) to the ‘end-user’ (KRC). The ultimate borrower (KRC) was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL and PBC to to finance 90% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts that it signed with CRBC on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. More specifically, the proceeds from the PBC were to be used to finance 42.06% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts and be exclusively utilized to make payment for the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract). The proceeds from the BCL were to be used to finance (a) 31.95% of the total cost ($849,000,000 out of $2,657,401,776.17) of the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract), (b) 85% of the total cost ($974,772,357.44 out of $1,146,791,008.75) of the Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract, and (c) 85% of the total cost ($179,811,671,43 out of $211,543,142.85) of the medium-long term buyer’s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 10% was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing, of which not less than $380,420,427.8 was to be applied to the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract. In order to facilitate repayment of its debts to China Eximbank, the Kenyan Government provided an assurance to the lender that it would guarantee a minimum amount of railway freight through the execution of a take-or-pay agreement between KRC and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The KPA also agreed to levy a new, 1.5% tax on imported goods (called the ‘Railway Development Levy’). The Railway Development Levy was designed to serve as insurance in case the revenues generated through the take-or-pay arrangement fall short of the amount required to service the China Eximbank loans. The borrower also expected to use to the Railway Development Levy to finance the Kenyan government’s portion (15%) of the project (commercial contract) cost.    The BCL and PBC are secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues that are deposited into a revenue account (escrow account) and a minimum cash balance in a payment account (escrow account). A 2014 Escrow Account Agreement between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the Government of Kenya, and China Eximbank specifies that ‘KRC shall ensure that the following minimum amounts in [U.S.] Dollars [USD] shall be held in the Payment Account, so long as an Secured Obligations under the Loan [PBC and BCL] Agreement remain outstanding: (i) when the Loans are within the applicable Grace Period, no less than US$84,000,000, which shall be deposited into the Payment Account in the following installments: 1) an amount, of US$16,800,000, shall be deposited into the Payment Account before the first disbursement, 2) an amount of US$16,800,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before January 15, 2015, 3) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2015, 4) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2016; (ii) when any Loan [PBC or BCL] is within its Repayment Period, no less than US$250,000,000, and (iii) when the [BCL is] fully repaid, no less than US$80,000,000.' If the borrower does not adhere to its loan repayment schedule (runs arrears), the escrow account bank is responsible for withdrawing funds the overdue payment amount (plus 1% penalty interest) from the payment account and remitting payment to China Eximbank; then, the escrow account bank reimburses/replenishes the payment account with funds from the revenue account (where project revenues are deposited).  According to the audited financial statements of KRC, the cash balances in the escrow accounts were as follows: KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2014, KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2015, KES 5,981,587,210 (USD 59,217,713.37)  in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 2,708 (USD 26.80) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2016, KES 8,713,702,264 (USD 85,394,282.18) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 72,472,503 (USD 702,983) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2017, KES 8,912,943,504 (USD 88,238,140.68) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 424,026,583 (USD 4,197,863.17) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,412,855,396 (USD 13,987,268.42) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2018, KES 9,078,451,382 (USD 88,968,823.54) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 5,334,370,360 (USD 52,276,829.52) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,567,057,226 (USD 15,357,160.81) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2019, and KES 9,195,200,216 (USD 86,434,882.03) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 18,447,296,513 (USD 173,404,587.22) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 2,991,272,808 (USD 28,117,964.39) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2020. Given that the BCL was still in its grace period until August 11, 2019 and the Preferential Buyer’s Credit (PBC) was still in its grace period until August 11, 2021, the borrower evidently complied with the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 84 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while the BCL and PBC were still in their grace periods and the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 250 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while either loan was in its repayment period (as specified in the Escrow Account Agreement).  The borrower made principal repayments on the BCL worth $100,179,201.44 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $200,358,402.88 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The BCL’s amount outstanding was $1,903,404,827.42 as of June 30, 2020, $1,703,046,424.53 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,502,688,021.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The borrower made no principal repayments on the PBC between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and principal repayments worth $61,538,461.54 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The PBC’s amount outstanding was $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,538,461,538.46 as of June 30, 2022.  The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) is the largest infrastructure project constructed in Kenya since independence in 1963. The Kenyan Government and the Ugandan Government first promoted the idea of the SGR in 2008 as part of a Northern Corridor Initiative to link the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa to the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes Region. In August 2009, Kenya’s Ministry of Transport (MoT) and CRBC signed a memorandum of understanding, whereby CRBC agreed to undertake a feasibility study of the SGR Project at no cost to Kenya’s MoT.     In January 2011, CRBC submitted a feasibility report to Kenya’s MoT, which concluded that Phase 1 of the railway’s expected economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was of 14.66%, which was higher than the Government of Kenya’s ‘hurdle rate’ of 12%. However, the CRBC feasibility study later became a source of controversy. Its central conclusion — that the SGR was economically feasible — was inconsistent with the conclusions of previous studies undertaken by the World Bank and a Canadian consultancy firm. The CRBC feasibility study also included no cash flow projections. It asserted that the project would be highly profitable, but its estimates of the net present value (NPV) of the project’s expected economic benefits varied between $2 billion and $2.6 billion. The fact that the project’s estimated economic benefits were lower than its expected costs aroused suspicion about the credibility of the 14.66% EIRR estimate. The Government of Kenya’s decision to only allow CRBC to conduct the project’s feasibility study was also challenged by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), which argued that Kenyan laws require competitive bidding for a feasibility study. However, a Kenyan court ruled in favor of the government, and stated that the whole procurement process was legal. After the award of tender for the whole project was issued without competitive bidding, sub-tenders did not follow competitive bidding processes. Two Kenyan parliamentary committees, learning of this lack of competitive bidding, recommended cancellation of the sub-tenders, but they were ignored by President Kenyatta. Then, in 2020, a Kenyan court of appeal ruled that the SGR contract issued to CRBC was illegal because it was issued in a manner that is inconsistent Kenya’s procurement laws. The court ruled that the contract should be made public, but a Kenyan MoT official said that making the contract public would undermine national security.     The purpose of the project was to construct a 485 km railway from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then onward to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. Upon completion, the railway was expected have a total track length of 609 km. The project sought to transport passengers and cargo from Nairobi to the southeastern port city of Mombasa at 120 kilometers per hour, thus reducing travel time between Nairobi and Mombasa from more than 10 hours to more than 4 hours. The project was also expected to reduce travel times and transport costs by as much as 60 percent. If properly implemented, the Kenyan Government estimated that the railway would increase the country’s annual rate of economic growth by 1.5 percentage points.   China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation, and Kenya Railway Corporation (KR) supervised its work. Project implementation commenced on December 12, 2014. The project reached completion on May 31, 2017, eighteen months ahead of schedule. President Kenyatta scheduled the completion ceremony just two months before voters would go to the polls and on Madaraka Day—a national holiday that commemorates the day when colonial Britain granted Kenya the right to internal self-rule. At the project completion ceremony, President Kenyatta gave a speech and said that ‘[our] history … was first started 122 years ago when the British, who had colonised this nation, kicked off the train to nowhere ... it was then dubbed the ‘Lunatic Express’. Today... despite again a lot of criticism we now celebrate not the ‘Lunatic Express’ but the Madaraka Express that will begin to reshape the story of Kenya for the next 100 years.’ However, the project has become a source of local scrutiny and controversy. In December 2018, a letter from Kenya’s Auditor General to the Kenya Ports Authority was leaked to the media. It suggested that the Port of Mombasa’s assets were sources of collateral that could be seized in the event that the Kenyan government could not repay its loans to China Eximbank. The letter also suggested that the Kenyan government had waived its sovereign immunity rights in order to make this pledge of collateral. The possibility that Beijing would seize a strategic asset like the Port of Mombasa provokes a public outcry in Kenya. President Kenyatta dismissed the criticism that the Kenyan government had mortgaged the Port of Mombasa to Beijing as ‘pure propaganda.’ He told a group of journalists that ‘if you want a copy of the [SGR loan] contract we have with China I can get it to you tomorrow. […]’. But neither the BCL contract nor the PBC contract was made public. In 2018, the SGR project also became a target of an anti-corruption drive by Kenya's Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP). According to Reuters, the “Kenyan authorities […] arrested the head of the agency that manages public land and the boss of the state railway on suspicion of corruption over land allocation for the new $3-billion flagship Nairobi-Mombasa railway. […] Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri, the chairman of National Land Commission, was one of 18 officials, businesspeople and companies named in a statement listing arrests that was posted …on the prosecutor’s office’s Twitter feed. Also arrested was Atanas Kariuki Maina, managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation. […] The investigation that led to the arrests centers on allegations that officials siphoned taxpayer money through [fraudulent] compensation claims for land used for the railway.’    John Githongo, a former anti-corruption czar in Kenya, told a newspaper in August 2022 that ‘[t]he standard gauge railway is the jewel in the crown of corruption in Kenya.’ The secrecy surrounding the China Eximbank loan contracts that were issued for the SGR Project has also become a source of local concern. The Kenyan government has declined to make public the loan contracts in response to a court petition by two activists (Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo), saying they have non-disclosure clauses and that releasing them would amount to breaching a bilateral agreement, thereby impairing relations between the Kenyan government and the Chinese Government. According to an affidavit from Kenya’s Public Works Principal Secretary Solomon Kitungu, releasing the loan contracts would undermine Kenya’s national security ‘since [the] terms in the contract[s] touch on foreign government information with implications on national security and foreign relations.’ Two activists—Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo—filed a petition in 2021 at the High Court in Mombasa seeking to obtain all contracts, agreements, and studies for the construction and operation of the SGR. Through a coalition called Okoa Mombasa, Khalifa had previously attempted and failed to get the documents through Kenya’s Access to Information Act after the Kenyan government directed that all containerized cargo at the Port of Mombasa be transported inland through the SGR. This move reportedly had negative impact on the Kenyan coast’s port-based economy because it forced logistics companies to move their operations to container depots in the country’s interior. ‘We have a right to know the details of the project: how our money is being spent, the consequences of a loan default, and the government’s decision-making processes in signing the deal. Right now, we know none of this—the Kenyan public is completely in the dark,’ said Khalifa. Gikonyo, his co-petitioner, is the national coordinator for The Institute for Social Accountability, a Nairobi-based civil society organization.    Yet another concern about the project is related to its revenue performance. It was originally projected that the railway would move 22 million tons of cargo a year. However, a Government of Kenya assessment later revealed that the maximum amount of cargo that the railway could move was approximately 8.7 million tons of cargo a year. Also, one year after the SGR was put into operation, a parliamentary report showed that it cost more than double the amount to transport goods on the train than on the road. To make the railway profitable, the Kenyan authorities compelled importers to send cargo by railway instead of by road. This decision set off protests, riots, and court cases in October 2019 and November 2019. Then, on On December 4, 2019. Kenya’s senate committee on transport summoned the Kenyan cabinet secretary for transport over his directive to haul cargo from the port city of Mombasa to Nairobi exclusively by rail. The meeting — attended by activists, businessmen and leaders from Mombasa — ended with the cabinet secretary, James Macharia, promising to rescind the directive, which had reportedly hurt local businesses. Then, in September 2020  Kenyan lawmakers tabled a report in parliament recommending that the government renegotiate the terms of the China Eximbank loans for the SGR ‘due to the prevailing economic distress occasioned by the effects of Covid 19’. In the same report, the lawmakers recommend that the government renegotiate the SGR operation agreement, ‘by planning to reduce operation costs by at least 50%’. The SGR operators had to halt its passenger service for nearly three months due to concerns about the potential spread of the pandemic. CRBC operates the railway’s passenger and cargo service through its subsidiary, the Africa Star Railway Operation Company. In the three years the SGR has been in operation, Africa Star Railway Operation’s expenditure has always exceeded revenue, and the Kenyan taxpayer money has to fill the gap to sustain the company’s operations. A report by Kenya’s transport ministry tabled in parliament in 2018 says the railway made a loss of KES 9.8 billion ($90.3 million) in its first year of operation. At the time, the Kenyan Government projected a profit of $46.8 million for the following year. However, a report by the transport ministry in 2020, also tabled to parliament, said the railway recorded a loss of $200 million over the previous three years. The document also said that during this period, the railway generated revenues of $230.7 million but had operational costs of $430.5 million. The transport ministry cited reduced limited storage capacity at a Nairobi container depot, minimum use of the city’s freight terminal, and railway charges as reasons for this performance, arguably the kinds of details a thorough appraisal should have raised. The SGR operates both passenger and cargo services and while passengers embrace it for reducing travel time compared to buses, cargo owners shun it for reasons including higher fees and tariffs, additional time clearing goods and a lack of last-mile delivery, when compared to trucks. Kenya’s election in August 2022 became a vote on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy of debt-financed infrastructure building, much of it built and financed by China Eximbank. This was especially true for the SGR.    The opposition party candidate Raila Odinga ran on a promise to renegotiate the Kenyan government’s outstanding debts to China Eximbank. Speaking at Chatham House in London on March 16, 2022, he said he would assemble a tough team of negotiators: ‘It depends on how you negotiate with the Chinese. If you don't have negotiators they will of course impose their terms on you.’ Several months later, in June 2022, the ruling party presidential candidate, William Ruto, told Reuters that he would publish government contracts with Chinese companies and renegotiate loans with China Eximbank. Then, in September 2022, newly elected Kenyan President William Ruto reverted cargo clearing services from Nairobi inland container depot (ICD) to the Port of Mombasa. The expected immediate impact of reverting port operations to the Port of Mombasa was a shift to road haulage and a reduction in cargo business for the SGR. Ruto’s predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, moved cargo clearance to the Nairobi ICD to help ease congestion at the Port of Mombasa and boost its competitiveness while also boosting traffic on the SGR to increase revenue for debt repayment. The effect of Ruto’s September 2022 decision was to shift more of the responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans to Kenyan taxpayers.  In mid-October 2022, Kenya’s incoming Transport Secretary, Kipchumba Murkomen also said during his confirmation hearing that he planned to renegotiate the China Eximbank loans for the Standard Gauge Railway Project. He said that these loans were likely repayable over fifty years rather than fifteen to twenty years. He also said that ‘[I]f approved, I will look for the SGR agreement and make it available to the public because no one knows the contents of that agreement’. Then, in November 2022, Kipchumba Murkomen publicly disclosed all three China Eximbank loan agreements for the SGR project.  There are some indications that the SGR loans have underperformed vis-a-vis the lender's original expectations. In July 2022, the Government of Kenya received 'settlement notes' (an overdue repayment notification) from China Eximbank. Then, in October 2022, local media outlets reported (based on confidential Treasury documents) that the Government of Kenya defaulted on its China Eximbank loans for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project. The lender reportedly imposed a fine (‘default interest’ payment) worth $10.8 million (1.312 billion Kenyan shillings).  1. This project is also known as the Development of Mombasa to Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project. The Chinese project title is 蒙内铁路项目.  2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate that applies to the BCL by adding 3.6% to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in May 2014 (0.323%).  3. The PBC agreement and BCL agreement define ‘Long Term Service Agreement’ as ‘any long term service purchase agreement with take-or-pay terms (or similar agreement or arrangement) entered into or to be entered into between the railway operator of the Railway (being the End-User as of the date of this Agreement or any of its legal assigns or successors) and users of the Railway (including without limitation the Kenya Ports Authority), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lender.’  Under clause 1.4 of the September 30, 2014 take-or-pay agreement (also known as the ‘Delivery and Movement of Freight to the Embakasi Container Depot’ agreement), Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) were required to enter into a Long Term Service Agreement which provides under paragraph(C) of the preamble that ‘the repayment of the principal and payment of the interest and fees of the loans are to be secured, inter alia, by a Long Term Service Agreement with an aim of guaranteeing a minimum amount of freight throughout the term of the agreement to be charged and received by the operator for the project, which shall be used to secure the repayment of principal and interest’. Further, the Long Term Service Agreement between KRC and KPA also provides under clause 7 (c) that “that KPA shall make good any short fall arising either on account of failure to consign the minimum cargo as stipulated in Schedule 1 or to remit the amount of money commensurate with the volume of cargo so consigned and shall pay to Kenya Railways Corporation such an amount as is required to make good the short fall within a period of 30 days following the completion of reconciliation exercise”. In the event of default by Kenya Railways Corporation to pay China Eximbank collected freight and service charges, Kenya Ports Authority would be compelled to deposit the amount due to Kenya Railways Corporation [in a] bank account designated by the China Eximbank.’  4. Under the ‘Take or Pay’ Agreement, KPA undertakes to consign a defined minimum volume of freight to the Embakasi Inland Container Depot to be transported on the Standard Gauge Railway. This agreement will form part of the security package (collateral arrangement) for the loan.  5. On December 5, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $1,397,927,373.27 for Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway Project. This loan is captured via Project ID#47025. 6.

The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are follows: a 0% interest rate, no grace period, and a 19.9-year maturity. The borrower was to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost of an EPC (commercial) contract, which it signed with Shandong Electric Power Construction Corporation III (SEPCOIII, SEPCO3, or 山东电力建设第三工程公司) on July 25, 2013 (following an international call for tenders). The specified duration of the EPC contract was 36 months, beginning on December 31, 2014 and ending on December 30, 2017.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 318-megawatt coal-fired plant in ""Hassi Blal"" near the city of Jerada. The location of the plant is close to the country’s border with Algeria and approximately 60 km south of the city of Oujda (in eastern Morocco). The plant was to be built on the same site as an existing 165MW Jerada power plant, thereby increasing total on-site power generation capacity to approximately 483 MW. The existing plant was made up of three 55MW units operating on pulverized coal. Coal transport from the port of Nador was provided by train and truck. The new plant was also designed to operate on pulverized coal and the electricity that it produced was to be evacuated to the Bourdim substation via two new 400 kV transmission lines. Emergency power was to be provided by a new 60 kV transmission line. The two 400 kV lines and the 60 kV line were to be built by ONEE.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 19, 2014. However, construction began on October 3, 2014. The power plant started generating electricity on September 19, 2017 and it was put into commercial operation ahead of schedule on December 18, 2017. Some sources suggest that, upon completion, the power generation capacity of the plant was 350MW rather than 318MW. A post-loan project inspection was undertaken by China Eximbank on June 25, 2019.  1. This project is also known as the 318MW Jerada Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project and the 1X350MW Jerada Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project.

Then, on November 15, 2014, the Government of Mozambique ratified this loan agreement. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity.   This project involved the construction of a dock that is 377 meters long (compared with 188 meters previously) in order to allow 16 industrial vessels to be moored simultaneously. It also involved the installation of six cold stores, an ice factory with a capacity of 60 tonnes per day, a fish processing room with a capacity of 50 tonnes per day, and a handling capacity of 700,000 tons per year.

The $416.5 million project involved the upgrading and rehabilitation of an 288 km road from Beira to Machipanda and a bridge that was constructed over the River Pungue. The completion of the project was expected to shorten the journey from the western border of Mozambique to the port of Beira from 7 hours to 4 hours, thereby facilitating regional connectivity, stimulating the development of agriculture, tourism and other industries along the route, and promoting exports.   AFECC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 10, 2014. However, construction did not begin until April 1, 2015.

64072,"China Eximbank provides $55 million loan for Phases 1 and 2 of Solar Street Light Installation Project On November 23, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Togo signed a preferential loan framework agreement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Solar Street Light Installation Project. Then, near the end of 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Togo signed a $55 million loan agreement for Phases 1 and 2 of the Solar Street Light Installation Project. This loan carried the following terms: a maturity of 25 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an estimated interest rate of 1.8728%.  The purpose of the project was to install 13,000 solar-powered streetlights across Togo. The installation of the solar-power streetlights was prioritized in dispensaries, schools, markets and other public places. The completed project was to provide lighting for 144 km of road, improving traffic safety at night.  Upon completion, the project was expected to facilitate a significant reduction in government spending on public street lighting (which totaled nearly $4 million in 2011‑2014) and bring Togo closer to its goal of using 10% renewable energy by 2020.  ZTE Corporation was the contractor responsible for project implementation; they also agreed to provide training on project maintenance to local personnel. The African Biofuel and Renewable Energy Company (SABER-ABREC) (also known as ""Société africaine des biocarburants et des énergies renouvelables"") collaborated with ZTE to implement the project. The project was placed under the supervision of Togo's Ministry of Energy and Mines.  In 2011, the Ministry of Mines and Energy conducted a feasibility study for the project. Phase 1 involved the installation of 7,042 solar street lights in more than 400 towns and villages in Togo. It began at the end of 2013 and was completed in August 2015. The second phase involved the construction of the remaining 5958 streetlights. Phase 2 began in mid-February 2016 and was originally expected to reach completion in June 2016. The project was ultimately completed sometime between March 2016 and August 2018 (likely around June 2016). A publication released in 2018 noted that the many of the solar-powered street lights were not lit up despite some being barely two years old. 1.

68494,"China Eximbank provides RMB 628 million government concessional loan for Phase 2 of Lomé Bypass Road Development and Asphalting Project (Linked to Project ID#68450 and #72803) On December 27, 2013, the Chinese Government and the Government of Togo signed an RMB 628 million (CFA 49.282 billion franc) preferential loan framework agreement for the Phase 2 of Lomé Bypass Road Development and Asphalting Project (as captured via Project ID#72803). Then, on February 14, 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Togo signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase 2 of the Lomé Bypass Road Development and Asphalting Project). The loan (GCL) carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 1.8728% interest rate, a 6.3639-year grace period, and a 20.2271-year maturity.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). When the commercial contract [Marché N° 010/2008/MTPT/SG/DGTP] was initially issued on November 6, 2008, its value was $70,278,490,37. However, it was modified on June 2, 2014 and its value was increased to $98,831,214.  According to 2014, 2015, and 2016 reports published by the Bilateral Cooperation Department of Togo’s Ministry of Planning and Development, the GCL disbursed $49,090,342 in 2014, $11,108,065 in 2015, and $526,981 in 2016.  Phase 2 involved the development and asphalting of a 20.54 km road segment between the Golf Club de Lomé (along National Route 1 or RN1) and the town of Noépé, on Togo’s border with Ghana. The entire ring road was a four lane, 34.8 kilometers long road in the eastern and northern parts of Lomé. The second phase specifically focused on creating roads to allow trucks to travel to Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire or Burkina Faso, without being forced to use the congested arteries of downtown Lomé; it also included the renovation of secondary roads.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for implementation. The project commenced on September 10, 2015 and was originally scheduled for completion in May 2019. However, the project faced a number of delays related to the freeing of the right-of-way by locals. As of August 2017, the project had achieved a 31% completion rate. As of November 2018, it had achieved a 67.2% completion rate. By September 2019, the project was nearing completion. The project was completed by August 2020, but its precise completion date is unknown. 1. The Chinese project title is 的多哥洛美绕城二期 or 洛美绕城公路项目（第二阶段) or 绕城公路二期.

30919,"China Eximbank provides $789.33 million preferential buyer’s credit for 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project (Linked to Project ID#36211) On December 18, 2014 and February 20, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed two loan agreements worth a total of $1,435,158,682 for the 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project. Then, on February 27, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified these two loan agreements. The first loan agreement with China Eximbank, captured via Project ID#36211, is a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. 140302052015210069] worth $645,821,407.12 that was signed on February 20, 2015 with the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. Under the terms of the BCL, the Government to Uganda is responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The second China Eximbank loan agreement, captured via Project ID#30919, is a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 46 TOTAL NO. (340)] worth $789,337,275.36 that was signed on December 18, 2014 with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 0.25% management fee (worth $1,973,343.19), and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the BCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a $1,688,421,979.39 commercial contract between the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which was signed on August 16, 2013 and amended on May 6, 2014 and May 15, 2014 (via Addendum No. 1 and Addendum No. 2). The borrower was to use the BCL proceeds to finance 38.25% of the commercial contract cost and the PBC proceeds to finance 46.75% of the commercial contract cost.   The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for both China Eximbank loans, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of these loans to open escrow accounts with Stanbic Bank and deposit funds in the accounts over the terms of the loans to facilitate repayment and provide security in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of one of these escrow (repayment reserve) accounts was UGX 87,154,247,132 ($26,146,274.13).  UMEME Ltd. became the major privately owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network. It was involved as a contractual signatory to the Karuma PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. Loan repayments to China Eximbank were to be made through electricity payments under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with UETCL and UMEME Ltd. According to the terms of the loan agreements and the PPA, UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on “take or pay” basis, which means that UETCL was responsible for paying for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreements because they stated that “the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.”   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the PBC achieved a 85.4% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 24 loan disbursements (worth $674,527,385.55) between 2015 and 2020: a $101,179,038 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $16,324,648 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $16,009,159 disbursement on December 28, 2015, a $23,583,642.35 disbursement on April 27, 2016, a $11,850,199 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $37,208,639 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $18,949,811 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $8,637,526 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $6,927,809 disbursement on June 27, 2016, a $43,705,347.25 disbursement on September 6, 2017, a $28,149,577.68 disbursement on October 18, 2017, a $12,649,419.75 disbursement on November 14, 2017, a $39,929,383.45 disbursement on December 26, 2017, a $48,155,261.48 disbursement on April 13, 2018, a $13,785,395.25 disbursement on May 31, 2018, a $65,799,750.54 disbursement on October 19, 2018, a $7,308,794.90 disbursement on December 25, 2018, a $41,827,450.63 disbursement on February 28, 2019, a $36,212,516.45 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $13,979,022.20 disbursement on June 20, 2019, a $52,698,924.89 disbursement on November 13, 2019, a $10,010,402.52 disbursement on December 19, 2019, a $14,101,813.11 disbursement on March 20, 2020, and a $5,543,854.10 disbursement on August 18, 2020.

According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total disbursements under the BCL amounted to $581,678,517 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $517,096,376.38.   On July 28, 2021, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a supplementary agreement to the BCL agreement [ID#14030205015210069A], which extended the loan's availability (disbursement) period to allow for $73,915,778.59 of undisbursed funds to be utilized by the borrower (after the original availability period expired on December 24, 2020). The supplementary agreement also specified that, if the loan fully disbursed, the borrower would be responsible for making twenty, semi-annual repayments (worth $32,291,070.36 each) between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2030.  The 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project., which is also known as the Karuma Hydropower Plant and Interconnection Project, will involve the installation of 6 turbines (10 million kilowatts each), which will create a total capacity of 600 MW, making it Uganda's largest power plant. After the first two turbines start generating electricity, the remaining four turbines will be turned on once per month. The project includes dams, water diversion pipes, underground power plants, and transmission lines. The purpose of the Interconnection Project is to evacuate power produced from Karuma Hydropower Plant in Northern Uganda to load centers, which include Lira and Olwiyo in Northern Uganda, and Kawanda in Central Uganda. It will involve construction of a 248km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Kawanda transmission line; a 78km, 132kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Lira Transmission Line; a 55km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Olwiyo transmission Line (which will be initially operated at 132kV); a new 400/132kV sub-station interconnecting with Karuma HPP and 400kV line bays; a new 400kV/220kV substation with two new incoming 400kV line bays to interface with the existing Kawanda 220/132kV substation; two new incoming 132kV line bays to interface with the existing Lira 132/33kV substation; and a new 132/33kV Olwiyo substation.   The EPC contractor responsible for implementation of this project was Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The construction of the dam and power station officially started on August 12, 2013. As of March 2016, about 30% of the work had been completed. In October 2016, it was estimated that about 1,000 Chinese nationals and about 5,000 Ugandans were working at the power station. As of June 2018, 56 months from the beginning of construction, an estimated 76% of the physical work had been completed. Of the 6,000 workers, 5,300 were Ugandan. As of September 2019, an estimated 95% of construction activities had been completed, which included 100% completion of the Karuma–Lira High Voltage Line, 100% of the Karuma–Kawanda High Voltage Power Line and 98% of the Karuma–Olwiyo High Voltage Line. As of December 2020, the Karuma Hydropower dam had reached a 98.7% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Kawanda transmission line had reached a 99.5% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Lira transmission line had reached a 86.4% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Olwiyo transmission line had reached a 95.5% physical progress rate, and the Karuma, Kawanda, Olwiyo, and Lira substations have reached 99.9%, 99.9%, 93% and 99% physical progress rates, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was considered a force major event in that it constrained manufacturing and prevented the shipping of equipment and the travel of experts to facilitate the installation and commissioning of equipment. Other project implementation challenges have included a dispute between the EPC contractor and a sub-contractor, which halted the finalization of the stringing and energizing of a 2.504 km transmission line; UMEME distribution lines without required minimum clearances at Walusi, and Wabigalo; the vandalism of tower materials; accusations of public waste and corruption; the death of a worker due to allegedly unsafe work practices; and accusations that one worker was engaged in ivory smuggling activities. The cost of the project also reportedly ballooned from $1.68 billion at least $2.2 billion. 1. In July 2016, the Government of Uganda concluded an an interest rate swap deal with Standard Bank and Standard Chartered on its China Eximbank BCL loan. Under the terms of the deal, the Government of Uganda agreed to pay a fixed interest rate of 2.58 percent (0.79 plus a swap premium of 1.79) on its loan, allowing Standard Bank and Standard Chartered to pay the floating interest, which is dependent on LIBOR. Thus, the Government of Uganda only benefits from the arrangement when LIBOR plus the agreed premium is higher than 2.58 percent. According to the Government of Uganda, the purpose of engaging in this interest rate swap was “to ensure certainty and hedge against future [LIBOR] rate fluctuations. However, as of 2018, the Government of Uganda had not yet benefited from the interest rate swap arrangement because the floating rate remained below 2.58 percent. As a result, the Government of Uganda incurred additional costs that it would not have incurred in the absence of the interest rate swap arrangement. 2. In the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020 and the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, a single, $1.4 billion China Eximbank loan for the 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission Lines and Sub-stations Project project is identified. However, AidData records two separate China Eximbank loans for this project (a PBC and a BCL) based on the loan agreements themselves. SAIS-CARI also records only one set of borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and 2% interest rate. However, PBC and BCL agreements specify that these loans carry different borrowing terms. The BCL carries an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. The PBC carries a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 0.25% management fee (worth $1,973,343.19), and a 0.25% commitment fee. The PBC agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/znwu46a5h6vsclk/China%20EximBank%20Loan%20-%20Karuma%20Hydropower%20Dam%20and%20associated%20works%20Project%20PBC%20%282014%29%2046%20Total%20No%20340.pdf?dl=0.

AidData has calculated the BCL’s all-in interest rate by taking the average 6-month LIBOR rate in November 2014 (0.327%) and adding a 3.5% margin. Therefore, the all-in interest rate is coded as 3.827%. 4. On July 28, 2021, the BCL agreement was amended in order to extend the loan’s disbursement period by two additional years (to allow for $73.915 million of unutilized funds to be utilized by the borrower). The amended agreement [No. 140302052015210069A] can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/kklgyc75pkwedat/Supplementary%20Agreement%20to%20Buyer%20Credit%20Loan%20Agreement%20for%20Karuma%20HPP.pdf?dl=0. 5. The collateralization arrangement that governs the BCL and the PBC is described in detail in Article 6.12 of the PBC agreement and Article 12.k of the BCL agreement. Both loan agreements define the ‘security document’ as ‘each of the agreements and legal documents signed by the relevant parties for the purposes of creating security interests in favor of the Lender and enhancing the credit of the Borrower as stipulated in Article 6.12, including without limitation the On-lending Agreement(s), the Escrow Account, the Repayment Reserve Account Agreement, the Power Purchase Agreement, the Power Sales Agreement and the Assignment Agreement/Debenture. 6. Article 6.12 reads as follows: ‘The borrower undertakes that the repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under this Agreement shall be credit enhanced and the following arrangements: (1) After this Agreement has been signed by the Borrower and the Lender, the On-Lending Agreement(s) shall be duly signed as provided in this Agreement, in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. (2) The Repayment Reserve Account and the Sales Collection Account shall be opened and maintained with the Lender and the Escrow Account Bank and be subject to the respective escrow arrangement under the Repayment Reserve Account Agreement and the Escrow Account Agreement. The Repayment Reserve Account shall be used to maintain the minimum amount of balance as a debt service reserve as required by the Lender and the Lender shall be entitled to utilized the funds in the Repayment Reserve Account. The Sales Collection Account shall be used to collect the revenues generated from the Project and the required amount of funds in the Sales Collection Account shall be transferred to the Repayment Reserve Account as required by the Lender. (3) All the revenues (proceeds) generated from the Project shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable under this Agreement. (4) The Borrower shall procure UEGCL as seller and UETCL as purchaser to sign the Power Purchase Agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. (5) The Borrower shall procure UETCL as seller and the relevant distributor(s) relating to the Project as purchaser to sign the Power Sales Agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. (6) The Borrower shall procure each of UEGCL and UETCL as assignor/chargor to sign with the Lender assignee/chargee the Assignment Agreements/Debenture in forma and substance acceptable to the Lender, which which UEGCL and UETCL shall assign and/or pledge, among others, all its assignable rights and interests and revenue under the Power Purchase Agreement and the Power Sales Agreement (as the case may be) to the Lender. (7) The Borrower undertakes to ensure that the successors of permitted assignees and transferee of the parties of the Security Documents shall abide by the provisions of the relevant Security Documents.

36216,"China Eximbank provides $482.57 million preferential buyer’s credit for the 183MW Isimba Hydropower Station and the Isimba-Bujagali Interconnection Project In 2010, the Government of Norway provided a grant worth approximately $3.8 million for a feasibility study of the 183MW Isimba Hydropower Station and the Isimba-Bujagali Interconnection Project. The study was completed by a joint venture of Fichtner and Norplan. Energy Infratech, a company based in India, served as the owner’s engineer for the project until September 2017. The consortium of Artelia Eau & Environment and KKATT Consult was appointed as the owner’s engineer in January 2018.  On November 26, 2014, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 33 TOTAL NO. (327) 14202014016565] worth $482,578,200 for the 183MW Isimba Hydropower Station and the Isimba-Bujagali Interconnection Project. Then, on March 12, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified the loan agreement with the following terms: an annual interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% ($1,206,445.50) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $567,738,990.96 commercial contract [number MEMD/WRKS/2013-2014/00022/ERD] between Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE), which was signed on September 6, 2013 and amended on April 10, 2014 and May 20, 2014.   Under the terms of the PBC, the Government to Uganda was responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of the loan to open an escrow (or ‘repayment reserve’) account and deposit funds in the account to facilitate repayment and provide security (i.e. collateral) in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of the escrow (repayment reserve) account was UGX 35,909,807,892 ($10,772,942.36).  The China Eximbank loan agreement also required that UETCL and UEGCL conclude a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on a ‘take or pay’ basis for the project, and that UETCL and UEDCL and UMEME (or its successors or assignees) conclude a Power Sale Agreement on a ‘take or pay’ basis, in which UMEME or its successor is obligated to make deposits of revenues generated from the project into the escrow account. The loan agreement also specified that any shortfalls in collections and debt service would be met by the Government of Uganda. UMEME, which became the major privately-owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network, was involved as a contractual signatory to the Isimba PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. The fact that UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on a ‘take or pay’ basis means that UETCL was to pay for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreement because they stated that ‘the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.’   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 19 loan disbursements (worth $466,398,955.58) between 2015 and 2022: a $28,386,949.55 disbursement on August 14. 2015, a $72,126,626.59 disbursement on August 17, 2015, a $16,593,182.04 disbursement on November 19, 2015, a $70,494,066.49 disbursement on March 30, 2016, a $44,719,245.87 disbursement on November 8, 2016, a $8,903,102.70 disbursement on December 13, 2016, a $11,634,076.30 disbursement on April 18, 2017, a $9,797,214.32 disbursement on May 26, 2017, a $27,630,000 disbursement on August 8, 2017, a $40,394,439.87 disbursement on November 7, 2017, a $25,338,123.26 disbursement on March 30, 2018, a $9,149,993.75 disbursement on June 26, 2018, a $21,647,503.83 disbursement on November 16, 2018, a $13,983,133.08 disbursement on December 17, 2018, a $10,191,519.25 disbursement on April 4, 2019, a $12,490,242.92 disbursement on June 19, 2019, a $13,684,152.17 disbursement on November 8, 2019, a $2,942,702.21 disbursement on September 17, 2020, and a $26,292,681.38 disbursement on October 27, 2022. According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, total loan disbursements amounted to $440,106,274.20 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $391,848,454.20 as of December 31, 2021.   The project involved the construction of Isimba hydropower plant, which is located in the village of Isimba on the Victoria Nile, in Kamuli District. It is 4 km downstream of Simba Falls on the River Nile, approximately 50 km downstream of the source of the Nile. The project site is about 21 km from Kayunga Town as the nearest town and about 65 km from Jinja town. Its exact locational coordinates are: 00°46'18.0""N, 33°02'32.0""E (Latitude:0.771667; Longitude:33.042222). The project also supported the construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and the construction of a 41km, 132kv transmission line from Isimba to Bujagali. The Isimba power station will be installed with four vertical Kaplan turbine-generator units with a capacity of 45.8MW per unit, thereby providing a combined installed capacity of 183.2MW. The expected outputs from the 183MW Isimba hydropower station and the Isimba-Bujagali interconnection Project include (1) construction of the 183 MW Isimba hydropower plant, (2) construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and (3) construction of a 132kv Isimba-Bujagali double circuit steel tower power transmission line that is approximately 41 km in length. CWE was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several subcontractors were also involved, including Artelia Eau & Environment, KKATT Consult, and Energy Infratech.   A technical feasibility study, as well as a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for the power plant and transmission line were completed between 2012 and 2014. An SIA undertaken for Isimba dam by the Government of Uganda (GoU) shows that public consultations concerning the project were held in the Kayunga, Kamuli, and Jinja Districts between October and December 2012. The same period is cited for consultations held in connection with the EIA. Field studies of flora and fauna were conducted in March 2013. The EIA was only finished in November 2014 and NEMA granted approval of it on May 19, 2015. The project’s certificate of approval was also issued by the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MoEMD) in May 2015. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for the dam took place on October 5, 2013. However, project implementation did not commence until April 30, 2015. At that time construction was expected to be completed within 40 months (August 30, 2018). Construction ended in November 2018. Test flooding of the reservoir and the start of inundation of the Kalagala Falls Site (KFS) took place between November 2018 and February 2019. The power plant was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. A series of ‘associated infrastructure works’ — including bridges and a connection road to Kamuli — took place after the commissioning of the power plant. The power plant was expected to generate 183.2 megawatts of electricity a year once it achieved a substantial completion mark on March 31, 2019. A takeover certificate was issued to the EPC contractor (CWE) on April 12, 2019, after the Government of Uganda and CWE agreed that all project defects were to be fixed by September 30, 2019. However, on September 16, 2019, local media reports indicated that CWE was stalling the completion of a bridge associated with the 183 MW Isimba dam project over a $42 million payment dispute with UEGCL. CWE alleged that UEGCL was unfairly withholding payment. UEGCL asserted that the payment was being withheld due to nearly 700 dam construction defects that CWE had failed to repair. In June 2021, during a UEGCL board of directors inspection of the project site, the Executive Director of UEGCL, Eng. Harrison Mutikanga, told the media that he was not happy with CWE’s performance because of delays and quality issues. He said that ‘[r]ight now, water is leaking in the concrete to the powerhouse, the contractor has not installed a floating boom, the generator circuit breaker has not been working for one month and because of that, [and] one of the turbine units is not working.’ He also said that ‘[t]he firefighting system automation is also not working, equipment frequently breaks down, the gate on one of the functioning units was designed to last for 10 years but only two years later, the paint is going off and the rubber that is supposed to control water is coming off.’ Without boom lines, Mutikanga explained that the dam risked being affected by the water hyacinth and floating islands, which could translate into national blackouts. Mutikanga also said the delayed completion of the project had led to government losses: ‘We want a plant that is generating electricity reliably, safely and to also make sure that all systems are working. We want all defects fixed with quality equipment so that we contribute to the government objective of social transformation.’ At the time, Mutikanga also denied allegations that UEGCL had not paid CWE: ‘We have paid them up to 93%. We have also started paying the interest on the loan to EXIM Bank (of China).’ UEGCL Board chairperson Eng. Proscovia Njuki added that: ‘[t]he contractor has not been fast as we thought. At first, they were delayed by COVID-19, but we are here to find out the challenges they are facing so that we address them. An agreement was reached to extend the defects liability period by one year to allow for proper completion of all the snags till March 2021, but with the defects we have extended the contract till March 2022. If by then we find out that some gaps are missing, we shall not issue a final certificate of completion.’ Then, on August 11, 2012, a group of engineers, supervisors, IT specialists, welders, and cleaners—worked frantically to restore power in one of the turbines at Isimba dam. The previous three days were reportedly ‘a nightmare’ after one of the workers opened a wrong gate during routine maintenance works on unit three—one of the four Kaplan axial flow turbines—and then the automated gate jammed, causing a flood that submerged four floors, including the powerhouse. Each of the turbine units has a generation capacity of 45.5 MW but only three had been active after the dam was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. Uganda's Minister of Energy, Ruth Nankabirwa, and the Permanent Secretary of Uganda's Ministry of Energy, Irene Batebe, pitched camp at the project site. Ms Nankabirwa and her team were ushered into the control room. Across the choppy waters was a group of Australian dam engineers armed with monitors that fed footage to the CCTV room. The images gleaned by the divers were startling. Concrete under the water at the spillway gates continued to wash away and crumbling, among other things. The dam has four spillway gates. A spillway gate is raised and adjustable to allow the controlled release of water downstream whenever water levels in the reservoir—the large lake behind the dam—increase[s], including the probable maximum flood. The wearing of spillway waterway concrete requires a total overhaul. In June 30, 2022 correspondence with Irene Batebe, UEGCL chief executive officer, Harrison Mutikanga, flagged the crumbling waterway concrete, saying it was of ‘great risk to the overall stability of the dam with possible catastrophic consequences’ and that ‘UEGCL considers this risk to be of paramount importance as any delays to correct these failures only serves to increase the likelihood of these risks materialising and exposing government to great financial and reputational risk.’ As of August 2022, Isimba dam remained under the Defects Lability Period (DLP)— the time period specified in the contract during which the EPC contractor is legally required to return to a construction site to repair any defects. The DLP was set to expire in late 2022. CWE was reportedly reluctant to address the lingering defects until the summer of 2022. In September 2022, UEGCL employees warned of major safety issues and identified 10 ‘potentially catastrophic defects’ at the dam that, if it were to burst, could lead to massive flooding. The allegations of poor quality control on the part of the CWE are not new. In 2016, a legal claim was filed against the Isimba project in response to a leaked report that alleged that CWE was using substandard materials for construction of the dam. 1.

The project involves the expansion of Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka (exact locational coordinates: -15.325266732091906, 28.448490127571315). More specifically, the project involves the construction of a new presidential pavilion, passenger terminal, commercial complex, airport shopping mall, office park, warehousing facilities, fire station, control tower, and hotel. It also included the rehabilitation of the existing terminal into a new one to carter for domestic flights.  China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation is the contractor responsible for design and works. The contract with Zambia Airports Corporation Ltd. (ZACL) came into force on March 10, 2015 and construction began on April 1, 2015.   The project was originally expected to commenced on April 21, 2015 and conclude on October 20, 2019.

As of April 30, 2021, the project had achieved a 93% completion rate. As of June 30, 2021, $271,900,000 had been paid to CJIC (representing 75.53% of the EPC contract value). As of August 31, 2021, the new airport terminal building had been handed over and commissioned, but, the following works were outstanding: bullet-proofing and finishing on the presidential pavilion (89% completion rate); steel structure installation on the corridor connecting the terminals (35% completion rate); a widening of the taxiway shoulder (98% completion rate); a rehabilitation of the existing terminal building (5% completion rate); and a rehabilitation of ZASTI (10% completion rate). A formal airport opening ceremony took place on August 9, 2021.   This project has been plagued by corruption allegations and performance problems. In April 2015, media outlets reported that Zambian government officials and CJIC stole $25 million from the China Eximbank loan by unilaterally changing the original contract from $385 million to $360 million. This corruption allegation and contract renegotiations delayed project implementation by a few years.

This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the construction of the old terminal building and the extension of the runway and lighting system. 1.

Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe and Wang Gang, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, witnessed the signing of the loan agreement. The Phase 1 GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity and a 5 year grace period. However, according to the the 2018 and 2019 Blue Book Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure published by Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, its face value was later revised to RMB 286,080,176.66. The Phase 1 GCL’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $42,068,995.10 as of 2021. The Chinese Government also provided an RMB 50 million grant for Phase 1, which is captured via Project ID#62417.  The purpose of Phase 1 was to facilitate the country’s transition to second generation (2G) and third generation (3G) phone technology by expanding the coverage and capacity of NetOne’s network and more than doubling its subscriber base. NetOne Zimbabwe is a company that is wholly owned by the Zimbabwean government. It is one of three mobile phone operators in the country. It used the proceeds of the Phase 1 GCL to purchase equipment from Huawei Technologies and implement network upgrades to wireless broadband stations, while expanding coverage to remote geographic areas lacking service. Its ultimate goal was to reach 7 million subscribers. During Phase 1, a Broadband and Ascot Packet Core Switching Centre in Bulawayo was completed and officially inaugurated on December 7, 2011. By 2012, NetOne had successfully launched mobile broadband and 3G service in Zimbabwe. The geographical areas of the country that received upgraded internet service during Phase 1 included the Southern Region, Matabeleland Province, and Midlands Province. These provinces were reportedly able to use improved internet access to for e-health care, online education, and e-government programs. Phase 1 was ultimately completed in 2013, but its precise completion date is unknown.  Then, on August 25, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed an RMB 1,360,000,000 ($218.9 million) GCL agreement with China Eximbank for Phase 2 of the NetOne Expansion Project (captured in Project ID#62426). This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 5 year grace period. The Phase 2 GCL’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $229,411,424.25 as of 2021. Phase 2 involved an expansion in the number of base stations from 400 in 2013 to 2,300 in 2016. It was completed on September 10, 2015, and Huawei Technologies was responsible for its implementation.  On June 26, 2019, the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank signed an RMB 485 million ($71 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase 3 of the NetOne Expansion Project (captured via Project ID#52620). The Phase 3 GCL, which was ratified by Zimbabwe’s Parliament in December 2019, carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity period, and a 5 year grace period. The loan proceeds are reportedly ‘ring-fenced’ in an escrow account that is jointly monitored by the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank and were on-lent to NetOne. Phase 3 involves the installation of 3,000 additional base stations in 500 new sites, and Huawei Technologies will be responsible for its implementation. In 2020, an initial disbursement of $21.3 million was made through the RMB 485 million ($71 million) GCL. Then, in between January 2022 and September 2022, China Eximbank disbursed an additional $4.6 million. There are some signs that at least one of the GCLs issued by China Eximbank for the NetOne Expansion Project have financially underperformed. In mid-2022, the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance released a report, which noted that ‘[t]he low disbursements of loans is due to accumulation of arrears to active China Eximbank loans […] on projects such as the Victoria Falls International Airport ($54 million), NetOne network expansion ($61 million) and expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport ($3 million).’  By the end of 2021, total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project. 1. This project is also known as Phase III of the NetOne-Huawei Network Expansion Project. The Chinese project title is 移动壹网电信改造. 2.

The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.10% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a 0.50% management fee. The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Cameroon agreed to provide the lender with a repayment guarantee (as defined in Article 1 of the BCL agreement). The borrower also purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost ($637,136,492) of a commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation, which was signed on April 12, 2012.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 203.4 billion.   The Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project is a large-scale hydro-electric run-of-river dam and hydroelectric generator plant that involves a barrage that is 1,260 meters long and 14 meters high, with two overflow channels and a grand spillway to the generating plant. The dam site is around 26 square kilometers. The plant has four generators and turbines each. It is expected to inject 211 MW of electricity into Cameroon's energy supply network. The plant is located in Nyabizan on the Ntem River in the South region, 300 km from Yaounde. Sinohydro Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. On June 15, 2012, President Paul Biya presided over the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the project. Construction was completed in August 2016.   Project ID#57586 captures a separate China Eximbank loan worth $141.8 million loan for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The proceeds of this loan were used by the borrower for the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa to evacuate 211MW of power from the Memve'ele dam to Yaounde, the installation of 225 KV transmission lines, and the construction and installation of three transformer substations with a capacity of 225/90 KV in the localities of Ebolowa, Nkoumou in the South Region and Ahala in the Centre Region. As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaoundé evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate. However, the completion of Phase 2 depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line’s corridor. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the power plant and Nyabizan-Yaoundé transmission line since ‘powering up’ from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project has reportedly enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.

The purpose of the project was to facilitate the acquisition of three MA60 Chinese aircraft that would be added to the fleet of the state-owned Cameroon Airlines Corporation. This project was part of a ""buy two get one free"" deal. China Development Bank provided a RMB 215 million grant to the Government of Cameroon for the acquisition of one MA60 aircraft (as captured via Project ID#58109), and the Government of Cameroon agreed to borrow RMB 430 million from China Eximbank for the acquisition of two additional MA-60 aircraft.   AVIC was the contractor responsible for implementation. The two aircraft purchased with the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan were delivered on April 1, 2015. A few months before their delivery, a controversy arose in Cameroon around the quality and reliability of the planes. The Chinese Ambassador to Cameroon at the time, Wo Ruidi, defended the deal and said that the “MA-60s are reliable”. Then, on March 10, 2019, the tail of one of the MA60s struck the ground during a landing at Bafoussam-Bamougoum airport.

Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’ 1.

The project involved the construction of the 275MW Soubré dam and hydroelectric power plant located near Naoua Falls on the Sassandra River in the Nawa Region. The dam was to have a maximum height of 20 meters, a length of 4.5 kilometers, and a storage capacity of 83 million cubic meters. The project also involved the construction a 225 kV electricity transmission line from Soubré to Taabo, the construction a 225 kv transmission line from Taabo to Yopougon 2 (to serve the greater Abidjan area), and the expansion of the Soubré, Taabo and Yopougon substations.  Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It, in turn, hired Alstom to design, manufacture, supervise installation, commission, test, and provide other services for three 90 MW Francis turbine-generator sets, a 5 MW Bulb turbine generator, and other related equipment. Dam construction supervision services were provided by TRACTEBEL. The project was originally scheduled to last 56 months. Beginning in February 2013, the manufacturing of the turbines began in Tianjin, China. Construction began on September 24, 2013. The project achieved a 30% completion rate by October 2014, a 74% completion rate by March 2016, and a 100% completion rate by the end of March 2017. The transmission lines from Soubré to Taabo and Taabo to Yopougon 2 were officially inaugurated in June 2017. The project as a whole was officially completed and handed over to the Ivorian authorities on November 2, 2017.   However, the project did encounter several implementation obstacles related to the resettlement and compensation of populations affected by the dam, notwithstanding the fact that it was subjected to an ex ante environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA).

This borrowing terms of the loan, which is captured via Project ID#46183, were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation, which is widely known as Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $578,580,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the Government of Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy and Finance in Charge of Industry and Planning and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on January 30, 2012 and amended on November 7, 2012. The Government of Djibouti agreed to cover the remainder of the commercial contract cost ($58 million). According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the PBC (loan) had achieved a 32.2% disbursement rate ($114,115,453 out of $491,793,000) as of 2014 and it ultimately achieved a 84.6% disbursement rate (FDJ 73,753,000,000 out of FDJ 87,146,000,000).    The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 km segment from Ali Sabieh to Nagad of the 756 km Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to Doraleh port in Djibouti. CREC and CCECC were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Their EPC contract went into effect on April 12, 2012 and its originally scheduled completion date was April 12, 2017. Construction began on December 31, 2014 (when CCECC laid the first track down in Galile) and the railway was opened for use on January 1, 2018.   This project face several implementation problems. In 2015, President Guelleh pushed for the project to be completed before he stood for re-election in April 2016. Substantially reducing the project’s completion time pressured CCECC to accelerate their work. To address this challenge, CCECC reportedly used its own financing for the project’s initial stages until they received loan disbursements from China Eximban. CCECC also stopped work on the project for at least 2 weeks, and the Djiboutian authorities blamed CCECC manager Ding Zhaojun for the delay, claiming that he hadn’t settled all the required purchases on the Nagad to Doraleh portion. The Djiboutian authorities also complained about CCECC’s poor mismanagement, leading to $24 million in cost overruns because CCECC had not taken electrifying the railway into account. The Djiboutian government also claimed that CCECC used poor quality infrastructure materials and failed to comply with railway regulations. China International Engineering Consulting Corporation was later upon examine the quality of CCECC’s work.   On July 28, 2016, CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management agreement with a consortium of other Chinese companies. This consortium agreed to manage the railway for 5 years and provide training to Djiboutian workers who would assume management responsibility after the end of the 5-year term. It remains to be seen if the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway will find a path to commercial viability. Sinosure reportedly had to step in and write off approximately $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the railway. According to a 2021 report published by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), ‘[t]he railway is electrified along its entire route, to save on fuel, as this would need to be imported […] The decision [to electrify the railway] has, however, presented additional challenges. Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams, exacerbated by climate change. The construction of power transmission lines and lack of energy delayed the start of operations, even after construction was complete […]. The line has been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. Chinese stakeholders, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad.  Interviews also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the [Ethiopian Railways Corporation] has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. The plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals; it is not clear whether this has been properly assessed. Profitability is another issue. Initially, the price of a passenger ticket was set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to ETB, meaning that the project will generate less revenue than originally planned. This would not be a problem given that the project was planned to be catalytic, i.e. it was supposed to promote further economic activity, rather than being financially viable on its own. However, the railway does not seem to be playing this catalytic role since its last mile issues (it does not connect directly to the port in Djibouti or to industrial parks in Ethiopia) do not make the train a suitable mode of transport for business purposes. Our interviews revealed that last mile links were not [prioritized] during the construction of the new line, but are now being built. The last mile sections are managed by Ethiopian Shipping, a large parastatal. Ethiopian Shipping does not seem to be fully cooperating with the [Ethiopian Railways Corporation].’    There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On December 31, 2017, the Government of Djibouti formally requested a restructuring of its loan with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. According to an email correspondence between the Executive Director of AidData and an IMF Mission Chief to Djibouti, in 2019, the Djiboutian authorities conducted discussions with China Eximbank to restructure a 2013 loan for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project (captured via Project ID#46183). The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) had been signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and to reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period. The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021. Then, in March 2020, International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million. Two months later, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress.  Then, in March 2022, the World Bank published a report (entitled ‘Djibouti Economic Monitor Winter 2021’), which noted that ‘[o]n the debt side, liquidity tensions are likely to arise due to the payment of deferred debt service linked to the DSSI, the maturing of the two [China Eximbank] loans on the water pipeline project connecting Djibouti to Ethiopia loan in 2022, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway project in 2025.’ Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.  1. In 2019, the IMF identified the combined value of the China Eximbank loans for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti railway project and the Ethiopia-Djibouti Water Pipeline project as $814 million (see https://www.imf.org/~/media/Files/Publications/CR/2019/1DJIEA2019002.ashx). In email correspondence with AidData, IMF officials subsequently identified the face value of the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti railway project as $491,793,000 and the value of the China Eximbank loan for the water pipeline project as $322,050,000, which sums to $814 million. In an annual report published by Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy and Finance (https://www.dropbox.com/s/1tkijc0o367s9eh/rapport-annuel-dfe-2018.pdf?dl=0) in 2018, the face value of the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project is also recorded as $491,793,000 . 2. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that it released in July 2020, SAIS-CARI identifies the grace period of this loan as 6 years, rather than 5 years. AidData relies on the 5 year value reported by the IMF. 3. The all-in interest rate was calculated as follows: 0.409% (2013 avg. 6-month USD LIBOR) + 3% (300 basis points) = 3.409%. 4.

Then, on September 11, 2013, China Eximbank and the Djiboutian Ministry of Finance signed a $322,050,000 (FDJ 57,163,000,000) preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 1 of the Ethiopia-Djibouti Water Pipeline Project. The PBC carried the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 7-year grace period. The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#59425) were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $339 million commercial contract between Office National De L'Eau Et De L'assainissement De Djibouti (ONEAD) and CGC Overseas Construction Co. (CGCOC) Ltd., which was signed on April 11, 2013. The Government of Djibouti was responsible for the remainder of the commercial contract cost (approximately $17 million). According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the PBC (loan) ultimately achieved a 108.2% disbursement rate (FDJ 61,826,000,000).  Phase 1 of the Ethiopia-Djibouti Water Pipeline Project involved the construction of a 63-mile long water pipeline from the Ethiopian town of Hadagalla into the interior of Djibouti, where it was expected to supply safe drinking water to 700,000 residents of Ali-Sabieh region, Dikhil region, Arta region and Djibouti City.   CGC Overseas Construction Co. (CGCOC) Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Office National De L'Eau Et De L'assainissement De Djibouti (ONEAD).

This $4,273,890,000 public-private partnership (PPP) project was financed with 85% debt and 15% equity. 25% of the debt came from an Ethiopian commercial bank and 60% of the debt ($2.49 billion) came from China Eximbank. The original lending terms were as follows: 15 year maturity, 6 year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin.   6 Month LIBOR rate not identified in reports, so the average 6 Month LIBOR rate from May 2013 (when the financing agreement was signed) is used in the interest rate calculation, which is 0.421%. Total interest rate is 0.421% + 3% = 3.421.  China Eximbank provided this loan through three separate loan tranches. One tranche is worth $220,471,000 (covered in project #70083), the second is worth $981,260,000 (covered in project #70085), and the third is worth $1,289,029,000 (covered in project #70086). The loan was also insured by China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). However, the loan was restructured in 2018 when China Eximbank agreed to extend the maturity by 20 years (see project #61941).   Sinosure reportedly had to write off US$1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project.   In 2011, Ethiopian Railway Corporation awarded China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) a $1.4 billion contract to build the 330 km Sebeta/Addis Ababa to Miesso section, and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) a 579 million USD contract for the 339 km from Miesso to Ethiopia's border with Djibouti.   Track laying for the railway began in May 2015. On October 4-5, 2016, the railway was opened.   Then, on July 28, 2016, CCECC signed the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway Operation Management Service Contract on behalf of China Earth Group and China Railway Joint Venture‚ with Ethiopian Railway Company and Djibouti Railway Company, creating a public private partnership (PPP), and the railway was opened to traffic in October 2016.   In January 2017, Ethiopia and Djibouti signed an agreement to establish a joint company that would manage the railway. Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Share Company (or Ethio-Djibouti Railway) was then established in April 2017. On December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued the Yaji Railway receiving certificate to CREC and CCECC and on January 1, 2018, Ethiopia, China and Djibouti held a ceremony at the Rab Station in Addis Ababa, the starting station of the Yaji Railway Passenger Transport, officially announcing the commercial operation of the Yaji Railway and sending a round-trip freight train between Yades and Djibouti Port. On January 3, 2018. a two-way passenger train in the Ethiopian section was opened.   The Yaji Railway runs passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr). It is the first modern electric railway in Ethiopia. The 759 km railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport.   CREC and CCECC are currently undertaking all the maintenance, rail captaincy and control operations through a joint venture company (Chinese name: 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司).

Then, on June 11, 2013, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under proclamation no. 795/2013. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, an 8 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development subsequently signed an on-lending agreement with Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO). The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $340 million commercial (EPC) contract between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on October 11, 2012.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $293,250,000 (ETB 5,420,517,560) loan (PBC) achieved a 123% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 10 loan disbursements (worth ETB 6,659,539,738) between 2013 and 2016: an ETB 1,306,818,182 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 517,241,379 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 1,712,598,425 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 343,434,343 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 142,992,012 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 184,297,042 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 445,179,744 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 524,222,698 disbursement on January 7, 2016, and an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on October 7, 2016. The purpose of the project was to install a 153MW wind farm with 102 turbines near the city of Adama in a range of rocky hills in the Ethiopian highlands 100 kilometers southeast of the capital Addis Ababa. The project also involved the construction of 10 km worth of electricity transmission lines to connect the wind farm to the 230kv grid via the Koka substation.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV — a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) — was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Upon completion, it was expected that the Adama II Wind Farm would be able to generate about 476 million kWh electricity every year, thereby meeting over 20% of the electricity needs of the capital city of Ethiopia.  It was also expected that by substituting oil power plants of the same scale, the Adama I Wind Farm and Adama II Wind Farm could together save 160,000 tons of fuel oil and reduce almost 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrochina Corporation was responsible for the project’s feasibility study. CGCOC was responsible for the project’s mechanical work. Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. — another Chinese company — was responsible for the provision of the wind turbines. Construction started in June 2013. During the construction phase, in order to avoid dust and sand, water was sprayed on the excavated earth.  In order to minimize the impact of traffic noise and dust brought by vehicle transportation during construction, Hydrochina-CGCOC JV strictly controlled and managed the driving times and routes. Speed bumps were set up on a windy road to reduce dust blown by fast-driving vehicles. Trees, flowers and plants were grown around the booster stations. Hydrochina-CGCOC JV also built stone drainage and afforested slopes near the assembly site of wind turbines, thereby preventing soil erosion. Local floral and fauna species were reportedly protected. An official inauguration ceremony for the Adama Wind Farm II (Adama II Wind Farm) took place on May 18, 2015. The wind farm was then transferred to the project owner (EEPCO) and put into operation in June 2016. The 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project reportedly created thousands of jobs for local people during the construction phase and continued to provide hundreds of jobs for local people during the operation phase.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama Wind Farm II Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension).

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 3.08% interest rate, a 3 year grace period, and a 15 year maturity.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a commercial (EPC) contract worth approximately $1.2 billion between CET and EEPC. The Ethiopian Government was responsible for directly funding the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost.  The purpose of the project was to evacuate power from the 6,000 MW Great Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) via 500kV and 400kV power transmission lines. The project involved the construction of transmission lines (measuring somewhere between 1,136 km and 1,338 km in length), the construction of two 500kV substations, and the expansion of three existing 400kV substations.   More specifically, the project involved the construction of the 345 km GERD-Dedesa transmission line (two 500kV double circuit transmission lines from GERD to the new Dedesa substation); the construction of the 275 km Dedesa-Holeta transmission line (two 500kV double circuit transmission lines from the Dedesa substation to the Holeta substation); the construction of the Holeta-Akaki II transmission line (a 400kV transmission line from the Holeta substation to the Akaki II substation); the construction of the Holeta-Sebeta II transmission line (a 400kV transmission line from the Holeta substation to the Sebeta II substation); the construction of a Holeta-Sululta II transmission line (a 400kV transmission line from the Holeta substation to the Sululta II substation); the construction of the 500kV Dedesa and Holeta substations; and the expansion of the 400kV Akaki II, Sebeta II, and Sululta II substations.    CET was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project was originally scheduled to begin construction in 2014 and reach completion by 2016. The project officially commenced on January 10, 2014. However, construction did not begin until February 29, 2016 in Jimna city. The project was ultimately completed in August 2017. 1. This project was also known as the GDHA 500 kV Power Transmission and Transformation Project and the Grand Renaissance Dam-Transmission and Sub-station Dedesa-Holeta 500Kv Project, the Grand Renaissance Dam-Transmission and Sub-station Dedesa-Holeta 500Kv Project, and the GERD-Dedesa-Holeta-Akaki (GDHA) 500KV power transmission and transformation project.

30884,"[Cancelled Portion] China Eximbank provides $800 million export seller's credit to ZTE for on-lending to Ethio telecom in support of Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project (Linked to Project ID#69387 and ID#86927) On January 10, 2013, ZTE Corporation and Ethio telecom — a state-owned telecommunications company in Ethiopia — signed an $800 million supplier credit agreement for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project. On the same day, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and Ethio telecom signed an $800 million supplier credit agreement for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project.  ZTE Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. reportedly secured a $1.6 billion export seller’s credit from China Eximbank and then used the proceeds of the export seller’s credit to on-lend to Ethio telecom.   Both supplier credits carried identical borrowing terms:  a 13 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin. The interest rate that applies to each supplier credit (1.988%) was calculated by taking the average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (January 2013) when the supplier credit agreement was issued (0.488%) and adding a 1.5% margin. The borrower was to use the supplier credit proceeds to finance a $1.6 billion commercial contract it signed with ZTE Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  in July 2013 for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion Circles Project. The Government of Ethiopia did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the supplier credit issued by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  or the supplier credit issued by ZTE Corporation.   The purpose of the Telecom Transformation and Expansion Circles Project was to (a) provide fourth generation (4G) technology, a broadband technology allowing browsing speed of 100mb per second in Addis Ababa; and (b) enable third generation (3G) services across the country. Ethio telecom divided the country into 12 infrastructural zones (‘circles’), and made one vendor (Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.) responsible for 7 circles and another vendor (ZTE Corporation) responsible for 6 circles. Therefore, the project consisted of two sub-projects: the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project (implemented by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.) and the the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project (partially implemented by ZTE Corporation).   The sub-project overseen by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. entered implementation without any known contractual disputes with the project owner (Ethio telecom). However, the sub-project overseen by ZTE Corporation was plagued by a contractual dispute with the project owner. According to Deputy Prime Minister Debretsion Gebremichael, ZTE Corporation declined to work on the swapping of an old network in the capital city of Addis Ababa and asked for an additional $150 million for the service. Mekuria Haile, Ethiopia’s Minister of Urban Development and Housing Construction (and Chair of the Ethio telecom Board) eventually terminated Ethio telecom’s agreement with ZTE Corporation in April 2014.   Then, Ethio telecom approached Nokia and Ericsson with an offer to work on the project together and take responsibility for three circles each. This resulted in a deal with Ericsson. According to Debretsion Gebremichael, “Nokia did not respond to our offer, so we continued negotiations with Ericsson.’’ Ericsson proposed a $550 million deal for four circles (the south, south west, south east and south south circles) and a credit agreement with a 10 year maturity and a 7.5% interest rate. The interest rate and the maturity were adjusted after negotiation between the two parties, but they both remained higher than the interest rate and the maturity in the supplier credit agreement with ZTE.   After ZTE learned that the Government of Ethiopia was negotiating with Ericsson, it requested to work on the project again by agreeing to include the network swapping in the initial project cost. Hours before Andulem Admassie, chief executive officer (CEO) of Ethio telecom, and Rafiah Ibrahim, president of Ericsson for the Middle East and North East Africa region, finalized a deal for the four circles sub-project, ZTE Corporation and Ethio telecom signed a new agreement that gave it responsible for the two remaining circles (east and middle east circles).   Given that the Ericsson deal ultimately involved the provision of a $550 million credit for four of the six circles in the original $800 million sub-project, AidData assumes for the time being that the $800 million supplier credit agreement with ZTE Corporation was revised to $250 million.  The $800 million supplier credit that Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  issued for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project is captured via Project ID#69387.

On December 10; 2013; the Ethiopian Parliament ratified the PBC under Proclamation No. 812/2013 and the Proclamation went into effect on the same day. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% administration fee (management fee). The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 75% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between ERA and CCCC, which was signed on January 22, 2014.   $143 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#30886), and $190 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID #36251).  This follows an earlier agreement signed November 8, 2009 between China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia for a $349,000,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC), also for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#980). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), which was signed on or around June 27, 2009.   As of March 16, 2021, the $333 million PBC had achieved a 92% disbursement rate ($306,388,654.06 of $333 million). According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia (on March 18, 2021), China Eximbank made 16 loan disbursements (worth $306,388,654.06) through the $333 million PBC between 2014 and 2021: a $100,707,143.90 disbursement on June 26 2014, a $40,941,780.28 disbursement on November 27, 2014, a $25,384,969.23 disbursement on December 22, 2014, a $15,133,515.73 disbursement on June 12, 2015, a $24,221,555.29 disbursement on June 23, 2015, a $8,858,069.08 disbursement on September 22, 2015, a $12,870,031.74 disbursement on October 23, 2015, a $21,763,228.43 disbursement on February, 29, 2016, a $15,093,235.16 disbursement on August 19, 2016, a $15,901,936.27 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a $3,617,707.32 disbursement on June 14, 2017, a $3,317,569.64 disbursement on June 22, 2017, a $4,129,676.75 disbursement on June 23, 2017, a $5,861,882.71 disbursement on December 24, 2019, a $8,338,128.14 disbursement on March 15, 2021, and a $248,224.39 disbursement on March 16, 2021. The total estimated cost of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was $612 million.  According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $349 million PBC achieved a 60% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 16 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,847,852,378) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 651,221,131 disbursement on January 8, 2011, an ETB 682,158,333 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 236,792,990 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 273,157,439 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 450,455,536 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 216,893,784 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 853,439,518 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 996,656,460 disbursement on July 7, 2013, an ETB 236,742,424 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 130,076,628 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 984,252 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 808,081 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 491,459 disbursement on July 7, 2015, an ETB 282,589 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 33,385,378 disbursement on October 7, 2016, and an ETB 84,306,376 disbursement on July 7, 2017.   The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.  The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project’s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project’s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014. The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road — with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide — that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project’s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor. Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016.   After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.  1.

The shared purpose of these two projects — the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project and the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project — was to increase the annual passenger handling capacity of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from the 7 million to 22 million. These two projects involved the expansion of an existing terminal (Terminal 1) with a floor area of 30,000 square meters for domestic and regional trips, the construction of a new terminal (Terminal 2) with a floor area of 74,000 square meters for international trips, and the construction of a VIP terminal. Upon completion, Terminal 2 was expected to have three floors—arrival, departure and ground floors — and include boarding areas, lounges, recreation centers, shopping malls, offices, parking, and other facilities. The VIP terminal — designed for use by leaders, senior government officials, diplomats and other dignitaries — was expected to includes various saloons, lounges, conference rooms, recreation centers, duty-free shops, an IT center and an exclusive parking lot.   Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is located in the Bole area of the city of Addis Ababa, 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of the city center and 65 km (40 mi) north of Debre Zeyit. Its coordinates are 08°58′40″N 38°47′58″E.  CCCC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by EAE. The French construction firm ADP Ingénierie supervised construction activities, while the design of the project was managed by CPG Corporation Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company. Shanxi Construction investment Group Co. Ltd was also involved in the project (most likely as a subcontractor).   The purpose of the $225 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct Terminal 2 (‘Phase 1’). The purpose of the $138 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct the VIP terminal and expand Terminal 1 (‘Phase 2’).  Phase 1 construction activities began in June 2014. By December 11, 2016, Phase 1 had achieved a 40% completion rate. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by January 2018 (in time for the 30th Ordinary Summit of the African Union). However, it was ultimately completed and officially inaugurated on January 27, 2019. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Phase 2 implementation activities commenced in September 2017 and were still underway four years later. On March 30, 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the new VIP terminal being built at the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Phase 2 was originally scheduled for completion on May 15, 2021.

Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.  1. Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is sometimes simply referred to as Bole International Airport (in Addis Ababa).

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% administration fee (management fee). The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 75% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between ERA and CCCC, which was signed on January 22, 2014.   $143 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#30886), and $190 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID #36251).   As of March 16, 2021, the $332 million PBC had achieved a 92% disbursement rate ($306,388,654.06 of $333 million). According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia (on March 18, 2021), China Eximbank made 16 loan disbursements (worth $306,388,654.06) through the $333 million PBC between 2014 and 2021: a $100,707,143.90 disbursement on June 26 2014, a $40,941,780.28 disbursement on November 27, 2014, a $25,384,969.23 disbursement on December 22, 2014, a $15,133,515.73 disbursement on June 12, 2015, a $24,221,555.29 disbursement on June 23, 2015, a $8,858,069.08 disbursement on September 22, 2015, a $12,870,031.74 disbursement on October 23, 2015, a $21,763,228.43 disbursement on February, 29, 2016, a $15,093,235.16 disbursement on August 19, 2016, a $15,901,936.27 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a $3,617,707.32 disbursement on June 14, 2017, a $3,317,569.64 disbursement on June 22, 2017, a $4,129,676.75 disbursement on June 23, 2017, a $5,861,882.71 disbursement on December 24, 2019, a $8,338,128.14 disbursement on March 15, 2021, and a $248,224.39 disbursement on March 16, 2021. The total estimated cost of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was $612 million.   This follows the signing of a $349,000,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, also between China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia, on November 8, 2009. The borrowing terms of this PBC (captured via Project ID#980) were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), which was signed on or around June 27, 2009.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $349 million PBC achieved a 60% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 16 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,847,852,378) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 651,221,131 disbursement on January 8, 2011, an ETB 682,158,333 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 236,792,990 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 273,157,439 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 450,455,536 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 216,893,784 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 853,439,518 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 996,656,460 disbursement on July 7, 2013, an ETB 236,742,424 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 130,076,628 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 984,252 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 808,081 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 491,459 disbursement on July 7, 2015, an ETB 282,589 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 33,385,378 disbursement on October 7, 2016, and an ETB 84,306,376 disbursement on July 7, 2017.    The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.  The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project’s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project’s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014.   The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road — with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide — that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project’s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor.   Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016. After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616).

The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016). The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015. In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs, as well as revenues, are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021. 1. This project is also known as the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Procurement Project and the Supply of Rolling Stocks, Simulators, Accessories and Related Services Project. The broader Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway is also known as the Djibouti-Ethiopia Railway Project, the Yaji Railway Construction Project, and the Addis Ababa-Mojo-Awash-Dire Dawa-Dewele-Djibouti Railway Project. The Chinese project title is 埃塞俄比亚机车车辆供货项目 or 东非亚吉铁路项目. 2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 3% to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in May 2013 (0.421%). 3. When the commercial contract for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally signed on October 25, 2011, it was worth $1,639,031,409.00. Its value was increased to $1,841,470,000.00 on November 5, 2012. When the commercial contract for the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally signed on December 16, 2011, it was worth $1,197,400,000.00. Its value was increased to $1,401,800,000.00 on November 2, 2012. 4.

Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016).  The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015.  In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021. 1.

70086,"China Eximbank provides $1.2 billion buyer’s credit loan for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#30171, #70085, #70083, #61941, #85163) On May 15, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $2,490,760,000 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was also backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). China Eximbank provided the loan in three separate loan tranches. The first tranche is worth $1,289,029,000 (captured via Project ID#70086) and it supported the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. The second tranche is worth $981,260,000 (captured via Project ID#70085) and it supported the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project.  The third tranche is worth $220,471,000 (captured via Project ID#70083) and it supported the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013 and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade.

86927,"[Uncancelled Portion] China Eximbank provides $800 million export seller's credit to ZTE for on-lending to Ethio telecom in support of Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project (Linked to Project ID#30884) On January 10, 2013, ZTE Corporation and Ethio telecom — a state-owned telecommunications company in Ethiopia — signed an $800 million supplier credit agreement for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project. On the same day, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and Ethio telecom signed an $800 million supplier credit agreement for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project.  ZTE Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. reportedly secured a $1.6 billion export seller’s credit from China Eximbank and then used the proceeds of the export seller’s credit to on-lend to Ethio telecom.   Both supplier credits carried identical borrowing terms:  a 13 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin. The interest rate that applies to each supplier credit (1.988%) was calculated by taking the average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (January 2013) when the supplier credit agreement was issued (0.488%) and adding a 1.5% margin. The borrower was to use the supplier credit proceeds to finance a $1.6 billion commercial contract it signed with ZTE Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  in July 2013 for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion Circles Project. The Government of Ethiopia did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the supplier credit issued by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  or the supplier credit issued by ZTE Corporation.   The purpose of the Telecom Transformation and Expansion Circles Project was to (a) provide fourth generation (4G) technology, a broadband technology allowing browsing speed of 100mb per second in Addis Ababa; and (b) enable third generation (3G) services across the country. Ethio telecom divided the country into 12 infrastructural zones (‘circles’), and made one vendor (Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.) responsible for 7 circles and another vendor (ZTE Corporation) responsible for 6 circles. Therefore, the project consisted of two sub-projects: the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project (implemented by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.) and the the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project (partially implemented by ZTE Corporation).   The sub-project overseen by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. entered implementation without any known contractual disputes with the project owner (Ethio telecom). However, the sub-project overseen by ZTE Corporation was plagued by a contractual dispute with the project owner. According to Deputy Prime Minister Debretsion Gebremichael, ZTE Corporation declined to work on the swapping of an old network in the capital city of Addis Ababa and asked for an additional $150 million for the service. Mekuria Haile, Ethiopia’s Minister of Urban Development and Housing Construction (and Chair of the Ethio telecom Board) eventually terminated Ethio telecom’s agreement with ZTE Corporation in April 2014.   Then, Ethio telecom approached Nokia and Ericsson with an offer to work on the project together and take responsibility for three circles each. This resulted in a deal with Ericsson. According to Debretsion Gebremichael, “Nokia did not respond to our offer, so we continued negotiations with Ericsson.’’ Ericsson proposed a $550 million deal for four circles (the south, south west, south east and south south circles) and a credit agreement with a 10 year maturity and a 7.5% interest rate. The interest rate and the maturity were adjusted after negotiation between the two parties, but they both remained higher than the interest rate and the maturity in the supplier credit agreement with ZTE.   After ZTE learned that the Government of Ethiopia was negotiating with Ericsson, it requested to work on the project again by agreeing to include the network swapping in the initial project cost. Hours before Andulem Admassie, chief executive officer (CEO) of Ethio telecom, and Rafiah Ibrahim, president of Ericsson for the Middle East and North East Africa region, finalized a deal for the four circles sub-project, ZTE Corporation and Ethio telecom signed a new agreement that gave it responsible for the two remaining circles (east and middle east circles).   Given that the Ericsson deal ultimately involved the provision of a $550 million credit for four of the six circles in the original $800 million sub-project, AidData assumes for the time being that the $800 million supplier credit agreement with ZTE Corporation was revised to $250 million.  The $800 million supplier credit that Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  issued for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project is captured via Project ID#69387. The cancelled portion ($550 million) of the $800 million supplier credit that ZTE issued for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project is captured via the Project ID#30884.

60747,"China Eximbank provides RMB 810 million government concessional loan for Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#73174) On September 9, 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 810 million (or approximately $121 million) for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Booué Bridge Construction Project. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. In 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project.  The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Omboué (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogooué River Bridge, the 367 meter Booué Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.  1.

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it only identifies a single (concessional) loan for this project worth $134 million. However, the Government of Gabon, the Chinese Government and CRBC all report that China Eximbank covered approximately 95% of this $663 million project with a government concessional loan and a preferential buyer’s credit. Therefore, AidData records both of these loans.   3. Some sources indicate that this project also supported the construction of a 243 km road from Omboué to Yombi. However, these appear to be references to a second phase of the project.  The extension from Omboué to Yombi will eventually allow this road to link up with the Nationale No. 1, Gabon’s main road from Libreville to the south of the country (Lambaréné, Ndendé) and Congo-Brazzaville.

(2013) 06 TOTAL NO. (25)] with China Eximbank for Phase 2 of Dedicated Security Information System Project. The Ghanaian Parliament ratified the PBC agreement on November 12, 2013. The PBC (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 1% management fee, and a 0.75% commitment fee. The PBC proceeds were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $129,904,498.00 commercial (supply) contract, which was signed by the Government of the Republic of Ghana’s National Security Council and ZTE Corporation on October 28, 2011 and subsequently amended by the Republic of Ghana’s Ministry of Communications and ZTE Corporation on October 15, 2013.    According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $123,409,273.10 loan (PBC) achieved a 100% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 5 loan disbursements (worth $123,409,273.10) between 2014 and 2017: a $32,476,124.50 disbursement on December 31, 2014, a $31,605,686.71 disbursement on June 30, 2015, a $10,439,766.75 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a $35,897,245.34 disbursement on June 30, 2017, and a $12,990,449.80 disbursement on February 28, 2017.  The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was GHS 637,210,000 ($113,787,500) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 617,000,000 ($118,653,846) as of December 31, 2021.  The purpose of the Dedicated Security Information System Project was to strengthen the country's security and emergency aid services — including Immigration, Prisons, Fire Service, Customs, Ghana Armed Forces, Police Service, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of National Security — through the establishment of a national security information system. Phase 1 covered the main cities, towns, border entries and exits, and main traffic arteries in six regions of southern Ghana, including Greater Accra Region, Ashanti Region, Central Region, Eastern Region, Volta Region and Western Region. It was financed through a $30 million China Eximbank loan that was approved in 2007 (captured via Project ID#1862).    With support from ZTE, Phase 2 extended the national security information system to the country’s Upper East Region, Upper West Region, Brong Ahafo Region, and Northern Region. Huawei was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2. Specifically, it helped the Government of Ghana to equip a Ghana Police Command Centre (or Ghana National Security Emergency Command Center), with CCTV cameras and digital (eLTE 4) trunking network to respond more expeditiously to issues such as robbery, vehicular accidents, murder, and fire emergencies across all regions of the country. To this end, Huawei installed a 1.4 GHz eLTE network and 253 eLTE base stations to cover major cities and roads — the first system of its kind outside of China. Huawei also provided handheld terminals, vehicle-mounted stations, Emergency Communications Vehicles (ECVs), and fixed-access terminals and accessories to meet the requirements of both fixed and mobile situations. Today, the Ghana public security department reports emergencies through trunking handsets that can send on-site videos to the command center in real time. Then, the command center immediately invokes the wired and wireless cameras on-site and dispatches police cars equipped with eLTE stations for support. ECVs are used by the Ghana government guard. When the president travels, personnel in the mobile emergency command network watch over the presidential motorcade and communicate with the command center in real time via satellite transmission. Huawei also provided a unified solution that integrates eLTE, emergency communications centers, intelligent video surveillance, and telepresence video conferencing. As such, the Ghana Police Station can now establish voice and video communication with the Presidential Palace, and medical, fire fighting, and other government departments for faster and better-coordinated responses.   The Ghana Police Command Centre (or Ghana National Security Emergency Command Center) was officially inaugurated on December 15, 2017. However, the Gh-DCMIS identifies the official project completion date as June 30, 2017. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates were October 28, 2013 and December 30, 2016, respectively.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Dedicated Security Information System Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears).

This agreement established two lending facilities: Tranche A and Tranche B. Tranche A is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 15 year maturity, 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, a 0.25% upfront fee, and a 1% commitment fee. Tranche B is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 10 year maturity, 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee. Both tranches are collateralized against cash proceeds from the sale of crude oil from the Jubilee field, which the borrower was required to deposit in a debt service reserve account (DSRA). The cash balance of the DSRA was GHS 370,586,909 ($71,266,713) in 2019.  [Note: A requirement of the master facility agreement was that the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co. (UNIPEC Asia) sign an offtaker for the sale and purchase of crude oil. Under the terms of this agreement, GNPC agreed to supply and sell 13,000 barrels of crude oil from Jubilee Field each day to UNIPEC Asia over a 15.5 year period. The proceeds from these oil sales were then deposited into a special account to facilitate loan repayment and provide a source of collateral.]   Under the terms of the master facility agreement, subsidiary loan agreements must be negotiated to secure financial support for any given project. Tranche A is captured via Project ID#2034, and Tranche B is captured via Project ID#58586. In April 2013, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a subsidiary loan agreement worth $150 million — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the ICT Enhanced Surveillance Project. The proceeds of this loan were to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $176.5 million commercial contract between Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed in 2012. The purpose of the project was to build an integrated national security communication network with an encrypted PTT dispatching system, high speed mobile internet access, intranet VPN dedicated service, and national mobile video surveillance and emergency control and command services. The network has give main components: eLTE Broadband Video Trunking, Intelligent Video Surveillance, Emergency Command Centre, Data Center, and Emergency Communications Vehicle.  The ultimate objectives of the integrated national security communication network  were to establish an emergency response and disaster relief mechanism for the Government of Ghana; provide extensive voice coverage and video surveillance for security sensitive areas; and co-ordinate national resources to deal with the threats posed to national security.   Another component of the project involved the deployment of a helicopter fleet for aerial surveillance and monitoring of gas infrastructure/facilities. More specifically, this component involved the acquisition of four Z-9EH helicopters as part of an enhanced ICT surveillance system to support the Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Development Project (see Project ID#58586). It also involved the provision of spare parts and facilities for the aircraft and their maintenance, as well as personnel training. The President of Ghana announced that the helicopters would be used to secure offshore oil installations, enhance maritime security and anti-piracy efforts, conduct medical evacuations, and conduct search and rescue operations. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC) was involved in the provision of the four Z-9EH helicopters.   The project officially commenced in 2012. CATIC successfully delivered all four helicopters to Ghana Air Force on September 23, 2015. The project was ultimately completed in 2017. It reportedly resulted in the installation of approximately 800 CCTV cameras in Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi and some critical border areas such as Aflao, Elubo and Paga, as well as other critical national installations and some major towns across the country. It also and the establishment of a national Emergency Command Center (or ‘National Command Centre’) other operations centers for emergency response and command and control for law enforcement, security, intelligence, and emergency response agencies. According to Ghana’s Minister of National Security, Mr Albert Kan-Dapaah, “[the] project was largely successful, enhancing the communications of the various agencies and assisting to detect crime, road infractions, supporting major public events and providing evidence to support investigations and the prosecution of many cases where some details were captured by the CCTV network.’   According to Ghana’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, as of November 2018, the $150 million CDB loan for this project had fully disbursed.     1. This project is also known as the Integrated National Security Communications Enhancement Project, Phase 1 of Integrated National Security Communications Enhancement Network (ALPHA) Project, the ICT-enhanced Surveillance and Monitoring Facilities for the Oil and Gas Enclave Project, and the Deployment of ICT Enhanced Surveillance Platform for Western Corridor Oil Enclave Project. The Chinese project title is 的油气监控通讯技术平台项目 or 综合国家安全通信增强项目. 2. On October 31, 2019, Ken Ofori-Atta, Ghana’s Minister of Finance, and Albert Kan-Dapaah, Ghana’s Minister of National Security, submitted a joint memorandum to the country’s parliament to justify approval of a $199.4 million preferential buyer’s credit from China Eximbank for Phase 2 of Integrated National Security Communications Enhancement Network (ALPHA) Project (captured via Project ID#86361). It said that ‘the Government of Ghana (GoG) in its efforts to improve the security of the state intends to enter into an agreement to leverage emerging technologies to facilitate the determent and detection of nefarious activities in the country, safeguard critical national infrastructure and also to improve security and emergency response coordination with the use of state-of-the-art security and public safety systems. To this end, the GoG and Huawei Technologies signed a $176 million commercial contract in 2012, to deliver such mentioned systems, to complement other security systems already in place nationwide. Funding was provided by China Development Bank and all necessary parliamentary approvals were secured through the Ministry of Communication. The National Security Council as part of its mandate was the owner of the project and provided the key personnel on behalf of the GoG to support project implementation and subsequent takeover for operations and maintenance. The first phase of the project as currently deployed provided the underlying infrastructure for national security and emergency response priority communications for both voice and data, as well as the backbone for our nationwide video surveillance (CCTV) deployment efforts. It further delivered a national Emergency Command Center, for coordinated incident response, and from which the various security services are able to draw intelligence feeds. For the reasons, the Ghanaian President granted executive approval on October 30, 2019 for the implementation of the second phase of the project. The first phase of the project installed the communications network upon which network elements such as the CCTV, handsets, and other systems would ride. It also introduced a few of the CCTV cameras (around 800 cameras) for priority deployment to critical areas such as key national installations and hotspots. However, these numbers have been found to be woefully inadequate in providing anything close to effective coverage for our nation’s security. Recent violent crimes and other security breaches for which we were unable to provide active surveillance, nor provide post-incident video footages, have necessitated expeditious action to extend the coverage of the systems to cover dead zones and some hot blind spots in the country.’ This statement suggest that China Development Bank rather than China Eximbank issued a loan for Phase 2 of Dedicated Security Information System Project (also known as Phase 1 of Integrated National Security Communications Enhancement Network Project). However, AidData has not independently confirmed that China Development Bank issued a loan to support this project.” 3.

The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#53003, carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. The Government of Guinea used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Société De Gestion de Kaléta (SOGEKA or 凯乐塔电站管理公司).   The borrower (SOGEKA) was to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 75% of the cost of a $446 million commercial (EPC) contract between China International Water & Electric Corporation and the Government of Guinea, which was signed on August 15, 2011. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, SOGEKA’s outstanding repayment obligations under the China Eximbank PBC agreement amounted to $404.14 million. SOGEKA also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned power utility, Electricité de Guinée (EDG), and agreed that once the Kaléta dam was operational, it would use the proceeds from the sale of electricity (generated by the dam) in order to facilitate the repayment of the China Eximbank loan. When SOGEKA was first established, the Government of Guinea held a 51% equity stake and China International Water & Electric Corporation held a 49% equity stake. However, on November 2, 2016, China Three Gorges Corporation purchased the Government of Guinea’s 51% equity stake for $200 million. The Government of Guinea used the $200 million to meet the requirement in a separate China Eximbank preferential buyer’s credit agreement (captured via Project ID#187) that covers 15% of the total cost ($1.383 billion) of the 450MW Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project.   The Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project involved the construction of a 240 MW dam that is located 110 km north of Conakry on the Konkouré River. The facility includes a roller-compacted concrete dam 72 feet in height by 5,069 feet in length. The dam impounds a reservoir that has 23 million cubic feet of storage capacity and the facility’s powerhouse has three 80-MW vertical axis Francis turbines. China International Water & Electric Corporation — a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation — was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on April 18, 2012. Kaléta dam began to fill water in April 2015. The turbines began to run and distribute electricity ahead of schedule on May 29, 2015. The power plant was constructed according to Chinese technical specifications, and 90% of its electromechanical equipment came from China. The dam was officially put into use on September 29, 2015. Then, an official project completion ceremony took place on October 10, 2015. As of January 31, 2019, the Kaléta hydroelectric power plant had generated 2.708 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. It reportedly doubled Guinea's electricity supply. Electricity subsidies from the Government of Guinea increased to 0.8% of GDP during the first half of 2019 when the country’s state-owned electricity company, the Public Utility Company (EDG), started to pay for the electricity generated by the  Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant in January 2019.   On January 22, 2015, the Government of Guinea also authorized the ratification of a USD $78,064,538.90 loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Conakry Electricity Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project. The borrowing terms of this loan, which are captured via Project ID#91941, are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance an amended and expanded version of the commercial (EPC) contract that China International Water & Electric Corporation and the Government of Guinea signed on August 15, 2011. The purpose of this project was to evacuate power from the Kaléta hydroelectric power plant by constructing and rehabilitating 42 km of transmission lines and several substations, including (1) a 110 kV double circuit transmission line between Matoto substation and Manéah (Maneah) substation; (2) a 225 kV transmission line between Kaléta substation and Manéah substation; and (3) Tombo substation. The project also involved the acquisition and installation of electronic metering devices. CWE was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, Guangxi Transmission & Substation Construction Company was also involved as a subcontractor. The commissioning of all substations and transmission lines was completed on July 29, 2015. The project’s one-year warranty period officially began on August 31, 2015. A project performance certificate was issued on September 9, 2016.  1.

The database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020 identifies the following borrowing terms (17-year maturity and 5 year grace period). However, AidData records a different set of borrowing terms. In correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director in October 2020, the National Director of Debt and Official Development Assistance at the Republic of Guinea’s Ministry (Mrs. DIALLO Saoudatou SOW) identified the borrowing terms of this loan: 20-year maturity, 9 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. 3. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it identifies China International Water & Electric Corporation rather than China Eximbank as the lender; however, multiple official sources (including the Government of Guinea’s Ministry of Finance) identify China Eximbank as the lender. 4. In China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, the China Eximbank loan commitment year is identified as 2011. However, multiple official sources identify the loan agreement signing (i.e. loan commitment) date as January 4, 2013. 5. The World Bank’s Debt Reporting System (DRS) indicates that official sector loan commitments from China to the Government of Guinea (and/or entities backed by Government of Guinea repayment guarantees) in 2013 amounted to $387,038,766.50. This amount is roughly equivalent to the sum of the $334.65 million loan that China Eximbank issued for the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (captured via Project ID#53003) in 2013 and the $50 million loan that China Eximbank issued for the SOTELGUI Modernization and Expansion Project (captured via Project ID#64324) in 2013. 6. More research is needed to determine if the $334.65 million preferential buyer’s credit for 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project was collateralized. 7. In 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and China Eximbank pledged to fund the Republic of Guinea for the Lisan-Fomi-Kankan Electricity Transmission Line Project (see Project ID#64408) which is meant to transmit power generated by the Kaleta and Souapiti hydropower plants by constructing 225kV electricity transmission lines between Linsan, Fomi, and Kankan that are 393 kilometers in length.",True,0.9058188

Through this project, AVIC International was responsible for supply road construction equipment, cranes, motor vehicles, and spare parts to NYS. NYS ultimately managed to import about 300 sets of equipment from China. The equipment was supposed to be distributed to 47 Kenyan counties and AVIC International was responsible for building training and maintenance centers all around the country. The second phase of the project also has a clear focus on training students to operate the imported machinery and repair them. For example, through this project, the Kenyan government bought about 380 heavy vehicles from Chinese machinery supplier during the second phase of the program. AVIC International then employed a team of 12 machinery experts in Nairobi to train low-income students for three months.  The team also worked with other experts sent from Chinese manufacturers such as Sany, Zoomlion, and China National Heavy Duty Truck Group, to provide students with more in-depth knowledge about machinery. The Kenyan government, in turn, sent a group of 15 to 20 youths to China every year to learn how to operate different kinds of machinery from the aforementioned Chinese manufacturers. Students selected by the Kenyan government were between the ages of 14 and 20. The project was completed on April 28, 2017.  1.

ICBC provided $80 million of debt financing, and the Standard Bank of South Africa (Stanbic) provided the remaining $28 million. The syndicated loan carries an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.361% in October 2013) plus 803 basis points, a 1.5 year grace period, and a 15 year maturity.   The project was implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. As such, the loan was provided to a project company rather than the Government of Kenya.  Triumph Power Generating Company Ltd (TPGC) was established to undertake the design, financing, construction, and operation of the power plant on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. The project was structured on a limited recourse basis and it reportedly finance according to a debt-equity ratio of 75:25. The power plant is located at Kitengela (near the Athi River) in Machakos County, about 25km from the Nairobi city in Kenya. The plant has a total installed capacity of 83MW and will consist of 10 x 9.0MW medium speed diesel (MSD) units.   XJ International Engineering Corporation — a wholly owned subsidiary of China State Grid Corporation — was the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation.  As part of the project, Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) signed a 20-year agreement with Triumph to purchase power from the plant, which was expected to be a crucial supplier to the utility during times of drought when the country's hydroelectric generating capacity becomes constrained. The foundation excavation work for the project began on April 23, 2012, and the power plant has been in commercial operation since February 2, 2016.   The World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) agreed to provide $102.5 million in breach of contract insurance should Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) fail to honor its 20-year power purchase agreement with Triumph. MIGA's insurance also covers the Government of Kenya's obligations under the Government of Kenya (GoK) Letter of Support. According to Kwame Parker, East Africa Head of Debt Solutions & Infrastructure Finance at CfC Stanbic Bank, '[t]he highlight of this transaction is that it marks the first time that a Chinese commercial bank has used MIGA cover for a non-recourse transaction' and '[i]t's also likely the first time a Chinese financial institution is directly lending to a project company for a transaction in Sub-Saharan Africa that is not related to resource extraction, with no explicit sovereign guarantee.' 1.

This transaction was part of a broad fleet expansion effort by Kenya Airways called 'Project Mawingu,' in which Kenya Airways acquired 3 borrowing facilities to finance the purchase of 10 Embraer aircrafts and pay for the pre-delivery deposits for Embraers and 9 Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. These credit facilities were part of a larger $2 billion syndicated aircraft purchase facility that Kenya Airways contracted with African Export Import Bank (Afrexim) serving as the lead arranger of the lending syndicate.   According to KQ's 2017 Annual Report and a 2015 Kenyan Senate Committee report, the loan carried an average interest rate of 5.39% during the period 2012-2025. The Committee also noted that, given the current revenue base of KQ, its debt levels were unsustainable.   The syndicated loan was used to lease 20 aircraft, including 10 Embraer E190 aircraft, and 10 Boeing aircraft (9 Boeing 787-800 and 1 Boeing 777-300ER).

The sum of the principal of these obligations and the remaining government guarantee on other KQ external loans (US$688 million as of November 2022) is lower than the US$750 million government guarantee of KQ debts included in the stock of external PPG debt at end-2021. As a result, the operation will lower the nominal stock of external PPG debt, but raise its present value, due to the assumption of the associated interest payments by the government and shorter repayment period than previously assumed.' 1.

(461)A] worth RMB 443,788,000 for the Malawi National Stadium Construction Project. The loan agreement was then amended on May 17, 2013. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: March 21, 2033), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 21, 2020), an interest rate of 2%, and a 0.50% management fee.    The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 392,581,692.30 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 34,137,538.46 until 2033.  The purpose of the project was to construct Bingu National Stadium. The stadium has a seating capacity of 40,000 people, a standard natural grass football area, and 10 synthetic tracks. It has two major areas, the larger being the reinforced-concrete stands, surrounded by a vast, circular promenade. The seating bowl has two tiers along the west and east sides, divided by single strips of private boxes, 60 in total (2 presidential, 2 diplomatic and 56 other).The second part is its vast roof, which has a height of 56 meters. Beneath the roof there's room for all FIFA-required facilities as well as offices, a medical center, police station, and two tanks holding up to 20,000 liters of rainfall water. Spaces include two VVIP and two VIP lounges; four dressing rooms; two referee rooms; five event management rooms, and three management rooms. There are also eight shopping spaces, two lifts for VVIPs, 800 toilets, and a 400-car parking space among other facilities. Planning for the national stadium was tied up in debates of where to locate the stadium, as there was a move to change its location from Lilongwe to Blantyre to redistribute aid projects away from the capital. However, Lilongwe was ultimately selected as the site of the stadium after the election of President Joyce Banda.  More specifically, the stadium is located in Area 48 in Lilongwe. Its locational coordinates are 13.9438119°S 33.7530957°E.  Beijing Institute of Architectural Design designed the stadium with input from Malawian experts, while construction was undertaken by Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group. To reduce the overall cost of the project, any non-obligatory equipment, like electronic ticketing system, was scrapped and up to 900 workers were Chinese (total workforce of approximately 2,000). The project started on July 1, 2013 and was it completed on November 30, 2015, lasting 29 months. The stadium began operations in January 28, 2017 after having difficulty connecting to water and electricity lines.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the  Bingu National Stadium Construction Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2021, Malawi's Minister of Finance announced that ‘in 2020/21 FY, Government [of Malawi] requested temporary debt service suspension from bilateral creditors. This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In July 2023 correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Government of Malawi revealed that it was in negotiations with China Eximbank about rescheduling all of their loans with amounts outstanding. The Government of Malawi proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 50 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 90 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 89 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 88 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 87 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 86 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 85 million in principal and interest payments in 2032. China Eximbank proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 148 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 299 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 294 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 228 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 121 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 101 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 82 million in principal and interest payments in 2032. As of July 2023, a debt rescheduling deal had not yet been reached by the parties. 1.  In July 2023, the Government of Malawi's Ministry of Finance informed AidData that China Eximbank ultimately did not approve its request from temporary debt service suspension via DSSI. On this point, also see https://datatopics.worldbank.org/dssitables/deferrals/annual/MWI.2.

30340,"China Eximbank provides $100 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone Project (NICTIB) (Linked to Project ID#73385) In November 2006, Galaxy Backbone Limited — a public enterprise of the Federal Government of Nigeria incorporated in 2006 with the primary mandate of setting up and operating a unified Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure platform that addresses the connectivity, transversal and other technology challenges — signed a $117 million commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project. Nearly four and a half years later, in May 2011, China Eximbank agreed in principle to provide a $100 million preferential buyer’s credit to finance 85% of the cost of the commercial contract. Then, on January 5, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $100,000,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project (captured via Project ID#30340).   The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan (PBC) is September 21, 2032. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank PBC (loan) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($100 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $10.66 million and principal repayments worth $3.86 million to the lender. The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $96.14 million. Under the terms of the PBC agreement, the Government of Nigeria was responsible for paying 15% of the cost of the commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd prior to project implementation.   Advance payment delays by the Government of Nigeria resulted in major project implementation delays. In December 2006, Galaxy Backbone Ltd made an advance payment of $10 million to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Then, in December 2013, the Federal Ministry of Finance of Nigeria — on behalf of Galaxy Backbone Limited — paid the remaining balance of the advance payment ($7.65 million) to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd and officially requested that Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. commence project implementation.   The purpose of Phase 1 of the NICTIB Project was to build a 1482 km nationwide backbone network with fiber optic technology and connect up to 3000 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in over 3000 office locations nationwide. The first phase of the project involved the laying of fiber optic cable from Abuja to Onitsha to Lagos, and Onitsha to Port Harcourt to Uyo. More specifically, Phase 1 sought to install fiber optic cable from Abuja – Akwanga – Lafia – Makurdi – Enugu – Awka – Onitisha – Asaba – Benin – ore – Ijebu Ode – Lagos and also link from Onitisha – oweri – PH – Uyo. It also sought to establish Data Centers in Abuja and Metro access systems in cities like Abuja, Makurdi, Enugu and Lagos. Phase 1 was completed on or around August 3, 2018.   Then, on September 5, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed an RMB 2,300,000,000 ($328 million) government concessional loan (GCL) for Phase 2 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project (captured via Project ID#73385). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 22, 2038.   As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank GCL (loan) had not yet been disbursed and the borrower had not made any interest or principal repayments to the lender. The purpose of Phase 2 is to extend the fiber optic cable network to 19 states in Northern Nigeria. More specifically, the cable is expected to run from Abuja to Plateau, Gombe, Bauchi, Maiduguri, Kano and the rest of Northwestern Nigeria. Upon completion of Phase 2, it is envisaged that the fiber optic cable network will be 3441 km in length.   However, this project has encountered delays and implementation problems. In November 2022, Nigeria’s House of Representatives launched an investigation of the project, including a forensic audit of all relevant transactions to execute Phase 1 and Phase 2. The House of Representatives also urged Galaxy Backbone Limited and Nigeria’s Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning to ‘immediately halt all certificates of completion and payments, respectively, in lieu of the project, pending the completion of the investigation by the committee.’ These resolutions were based on the unanimous adoption of a motion issued by a legislator named Benjamin Bem. At the time, Bem noted that Nigeria’s Galaxy Backbone Limited, which falls under the authority of the Nigerian Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, signed an MoU with Huawei Technology Limited in 2018 to provide fiber infrastructure. He said following the signing of the MoU, Huawei Technology Limited was expected to design, manufacture and deploy a kit that would control data movements across all ministries, departments and agencies in Nigeria (with another loan from China Eximbank).   The lawmaker expressed concerned that ‘Galaxy Backbone Limited […] made claims that the completion of Phase 1 of the project is expected to reap revenue to the tune of billions of naira for the government’ and that ‘whereas there has been no oversight to ascertain the level of the job done [during NICTIB Phase 1] and verify claims of revenue generated by the agency, there is a current bid to access an additional [$328 million loan] to develop the NICTIB Phase II, which covers 19 northern states. He added that ‘[t]he House is [cognizant] of the need to ensure judicious use of the nation’s commonwealth, while ensuring the government’s ICT policy is implemented according to every aspect of statutory provisions guiding the execution of the project.’ 1.

This PBC (loan), which is captured via Project ID#30341, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is September 21, 2034. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 91.06% disbursement rate ($455.28 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $46.42 million and no principal repayments to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $455.28 million.   The Nigeria Four Airport Terminal Expansion Project involved the expansion of four airport terminals in Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt, and Lagos (Abuja International Airport, Port Harcourt International Airport, Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport). The new terminal of Abuja International Airport (also known as Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, or NAIA) covers an area of 56,000 square meters and is connected to the Abuja City Railway via a 60-meter-long air corridor. It has 66 check-in counters, 5 baggage carousels, an immigration check-in port, and 16 departure immigration checkpoints. The new terminal at Murtala Muhammed International Airport consists of 66 check-in-counters, 16 immigration desks at arrival, 28 immigration desks at departure, 8 security screening points, 6 passenger boarding bridges (out of which 2 has already been installed), 2 food courts, 4 premium lounges, 22 guest rooms and spa, 16 airline ticketing offices, a visa on arrival and port health facility, a praying area, more than 3,000 square meters of duty-free space, and approximately 5,000 square meters of lettable utility space. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the four expanded airport terminals will increase passenger capacity from 20 million to 50 million and increase jobs from the 60,000 to 1.5 million employees. China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) is the contractor responsible for implementation.   Construction began on or around February 13, 2014. The new terminal at Port Harcourt International Airport was delivered on October 25, 2018. The new terminal of Abuja International Airport was delivered on December 12, 2018. The new terminal at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport was completed in November 2019. The new terminal at Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos was completed and officially inaugurated on March 22, 2022.  Due to faults in the original construction of the terminals and other factors, the Nigerian Government requested additional funding for terminal construction activities from China Eximbank.   On December 27, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed two additional PBC agreements: a $208,905,161.50 PBC for the Four Airport Terminal Expansion Project Incremental Project (captured via Project ID#86025) and a $183,621,056.89 PBC for the Four Airport Terminal Expansion Project Ancillary Project (captured via Project ID#85965). These PBCs carry identical borrowing terms: 20 year maturities, 7 year grace periods, and 2.75% interest rates. The final maturity date of each PBC is September 21, 2033.

The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The loan’s final maturity date is September 21, 2033. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.14% disbursement rate ($562.47 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $26.36 million and no principal repayments to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $562.47 million. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 75% of a $1.293 billion commercial contract between the Government of Nigeria and a consortium consisting of Sinohydro and China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC), which was signed on October 19, 2012. The Government of Nigeria agreed to directly finance the remaining 25% of the commercial contract cost.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 700WM hydroelectric power plant — with four, 175MW power generators — on the Kaduna River in Niger State (exact locational coordinates: 9.90091, 6.28723). The project also involves the construction of a dam, electricity transmission lines, and associated substations to evacuate power from the dam. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2.64 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project is also expected to support flood control, irrigation, as well as water supply and fish breeding facilities. According to a ‘valuation report’ that was undertaken prior to implementation, the project would likely negatively impact 22,100 persons, 15,958 farmlands and 6,762 properties domiciled in 98 communities. Sinohydro and CNEEC are the contractors responsible for project implementation.   On May 28, 2013, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. Then, on January 22, 2018, the placement of the first silo of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) took place. As of June 18, 2020, the Government of Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that China Eximbank had disbursed 52.65% of the original face value of the PBC. By October 28, 2019, the project had achieved a 68% completion rate. The rotor of the first power generation unit was hoisted into place on September 30, 2021. Then, on March 28, 2022, the first (175MW) power generation unit went into operation. The unit was officially commissioned on April 1, 2022. However, the broader project has encountered major implementation obstacles and delays.   In 2015, the project stalled due to insufficient compensation of communities affected by the power plant (requiring resettlement) and litigation by aggrieved persons.  Nigeria’s then Minister of State for Power, Mohammed Wakil, confirmed the stoppage of the project in an interview. He said: ‘immediately [after] the Zungeru project took off, we had legal challenges. Somehow in the communities, some people, I can say powerful people instituted court action and in fact they succeeded in getting an injunction restraining government from further doing the project. […] At a point we had about two to three litigations on the project but the ministry has been trying to resolve the problems outside the court. A committee has been set up and they have held several meetings with the parties involved. It is a national project and we do not want to be unnecessarily bogged down by litigations. […] We are being careful and are engaging the parties with a view to settling out of court. That has tampered with our timetable but even with that there has been a lot of progress.’ Nigeria’s Director of Power, Sanusi Garba, said at the time that ‘you cannot pay 98 communities overnight. We have checks and counter checks at every point in time, and it is a slow and laborious process because you don’t want to pay someone twice and you don’t want to omit anybody.’   Then, in January 2022, three Chinese workers were abducted from the project site after a shoot-out that killed workers and police.  In March 2022, Nigeria’s Minister of Power, Abubakar D. Aliyu, said ‘[i]t’s unfortunate that the insecurity in some parts of the country has affected the delivery of the Zungeru Hydro Plant project because some persons were abducted by bandits and have not been released’.   The 700MW Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project was originally scheduled for completion by the end of 2017. However, its scheduled completion date was later pushed back to December 2021 and then December 2022. 1. This project is also known as the Zungeru 4x175MW Hydropower Plant.

This GCL reportedly carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, and an interest rate of 1.5%. The purpose of this project was to stabilize supply of electricity for 300,000 households and connect 150,000 additional households to the electricity network. It involved the construction of 474 transformer stations, the laying of 354 km of underground cable, the construction of a low-voltage (30kv) network with the support of geographic information systems, and the installation of 100,000 electricity consumption meters and 17,000 boxes and management systems (100,000 Compteurs prépaiement et 17,000 Coffrets et du Système de gestion) in the suburbs of Dakar.   Prior to the implementation of this project, Senegalese consumers paid their electricity bills every two months based on past electricity usage. However, the system was widely abused and theft was rampant. This project sought to introduce state-of-the-art software to combat electricity theft, which was reportedly resulting in $50 million of lost revenue each year. China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in 2012 and the project was completed and accepted by the Government of Senegal on April 29, 2016.   The first phase of this project was funded by China Eximbank and it is captured in Project ID#138. A loan was also provided for the second stage of this project in #53283. China Eximbank also provided a third loan for this project's second stage, which is captured in Project ID#53177. The grace period of the loan in #53283 was extended in ID#73130.

According to Moguldom Nation, the loan wielded a 25-year maturity and 5-year grace period. It is unclear whether the two sides ever signed a final financing agreement for this project.   As of February 2018, the Government of Zanzibar was still negotiating with China Eximbank for this loan facility. In June 2019, the Daily News reported that Zanzibar's Minister of Infrastructure, Communication, and Transport said negotiations with China Exim Bank had stalled and therefore the Government of Tanzania would use its own funds to support this project. On the other hand, according to a 2019 report from the World Bank, construction was ongoing with financing from China Exim Bank. A November 2020 article from The Citizen suggests that Zanzibar was completely starting over on this project and a January 2021 article from the same source describes a similar multipurpose port project now being implementing with Oman. Therefore it is unclear whether a final financing agreement with China Eximbank was ever signed.   In addition to $200 million of debt financing from China Eximbank, China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) signed an agreement pledging to provide another $30 million USD of equity financing on the condition that 13% of port shares will be lent back to CHEC after the completion of the project. CHEC signed the 36-month EPC contract on 21 February 2014. However, the project encountered various delays that had delayed implementation.

The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. It is backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance. An initial loan disbursement of $79.8 million took place on October 31, 2014, leaving a balance of $239.7 million to be disbursed in multiple tranches between 2015 and 2017. The loan’s amount outstanding was $214,554,588 as of December 31, 2016 and $273,700,750 as of December 31, 2017. Its amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $305,331,749.40 as of September 2021.   Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to Kariba Hydro Power Company (Private) Limited (KHPC), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is wholly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC). KHPC entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) and Nampower. It planned to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC and Nampower. The lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of $32 million in multiple, lender-controlled escrow accounts: $26 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and $6 million in a Maintenance Reserve Account (MRA). ZPC also agreed to make a $35 million equity contribution to support the project’s implementation.    This project involved an expansion of the existing 750MW Kariba South hydropower station. The purpose of the expansion was to increase the installed capacity of the Kariba South hydropower station through the addition of two additional units of 150MW each, resulting in an aggregate 1,050MW installed capacity. The Kariba dam is situated in the Zambezi river basin between Zambia and Zimbabwe. There are two hydropower stations at the dam: the Kariba North hydropower station, which is owned by Zambia, and the Kariba South hydropower station, which is owned by Zimbabwe. Kariba South was commissioned in 1962, and it generates electricity from water drawn from Lake Kariba, forcing it through a short intake and vertical penstock to a turbine where hydroelectric power is produced in the coupled generator. The water is then discharged downstream back into the Zambezi river. Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation of the Kariba South Hydro Project. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on September 4, 2014, and a project completion ceremony was held on March 28, 2018. During the construction process, Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD reportedly hired and trained local employees and brought more than 3,000 job opportunities to Zimbabwe.    However, the power plant encountered operational challenges after it was constructed and the borrowing institution (KHPC) has breached its contractual obligations with China Eximbank. In a 2016 Report on Parastatals and State Enterprises, Zimbabwe’s Accountant and Auditor General noted that KHPC and ZPC were in breach of contract for not depositing the cash proceeds from the power purchase agreement into a China Eximbank-controlled escrow account. The report concluded that ‘[c]ontrary to the terms set out in the escrow agreement, ZPC power purchase agreement proceeds have not been paid into the said account by ZPC. ZPC confirmed a netted inter-company balance implying that the power proceeds payable to KHPC are being set-off against inter-company receivables from KHPC.’ Then, on November 25, 2022, Munyaradzi Munodawafa, the Chief Executive Office Zambezi River Authority — an entity responsible for the Kariba Dam that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe and neighboring Zambia — sent a letter to Zimbabwe Power Company, which noted that water levels at the Kariba South hydroelectric power facility were at record low levels and electricity generation activities could no longer continue. The letter also noted that the Kariba South hydroelectric power facility had used more than its 2022 water allocation and that the Kariba Dam’s usable storage was only 4.6 percent full. 1.

30926,"China Eximbank provides $482.8 million preferential buyer credit for Phase 1 of Yaounde-Douala Highway Project On March 8, 2012, China Eximbank and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) signed a $482,800,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2012) 10TOTAL NO.(198) 1420303052012210261] for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% commitment fee, and a 0.30% management fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (PBC) to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $568,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Cameroon and China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC), which was signed on August 8, 2011.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 73.2% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 69.4 billion). The loan’s amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 188.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the Yaounde-Douala highway project is to facilitate the construction of a 215 km road linking Douala on the western coast with capital Yaounde. Phase 1 will involve construction of a 68.3 km long road, which will run from Yaoundé to Bot Makak/Bibodi. The six-lane highway will be the first new motorway since the country's independence. The project seeks to replace the existing hazardous two-lane highway, and it aims to boost domestic and sub-regional trade as well as shorten the distance between Douala and Yaounde from 265 km to 215 km.   CFHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 construction activities began on April 15, 2014, and the originally expected project completion date was October 13, 2018; however, by April 29, 2014, there was reportedly a protracted conflict between China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC) and the Control Mission led by the SCET-Tunisie/Louis Berger. Project implementation was delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of highway. The Cameroonian authorities also reportedly made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes, leading the EPC contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015, construction had recommenced, as reported by the China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road’s route and that earthworks had started not long before. Then, in 2017, delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2, 2017 and concluding in June 2017 after settlements were paid.  As of May 2019, Phase 1 had achieved a 74% completion rate. As of February 2020, the project had achieved a 80% completion rate and 6 of 36 engineering structures were not yet finished. In April 2020, the company in charge of supervising the works, SCET-TUNISIE, reported that the project was scheduled to reach completion by December 2020 in spite of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, the project had achieved a 98% completion rate.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding.

The borrower was required to keep a minimum deposit balance of 15-20% of total outstanding loans in an escrow account. All subsidiary loans approved through this framework agreement were to carry the following terms: a 5-year grace period, a 20-year maturity and a 0.25% interest rate.    According to the Congolese authorities, only one subsidiary loan was ultimately approved through this framework agreement: a $1 billion loan in 2012 for the Dolisie-Brazzavile Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#369). The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $1,000,000,000 as of December 31, 2019.  This project, which is also known as Phase 2 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project, involved the construction of a 376 km road segment along National Route 1 (NR1) between Dolisie and PK45 north of Brazzaville.    China Eximbank also issued multiple loans for Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#68874, ID#72780, ID#72781, and ID#72782). China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1 and Phase 2.    The groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 2 took place on December 22, 2011. Phase 2 was completed on October 3, 2015. The four-lane, 535 km Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) was officially inaugurated on March 1, 2016.    The $1 billion China Eximbank loan that supported Phase 2 was rescheduled on April 29, 2019. Under the terms of the debt rescheduling agreement, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay 33% of its its outstanding obligations for the Phase 2 (375 km Dolisie-Brazzaville Section) of National Route 1 (RN1) Construction Project within 3 years (more specifically, by December 31, 2021). For the remaining 67% of its outstanding obligations, the Republic of Congo agreed to a new repayment schedule that involved extending the maturity the loan by 15 years (from 20 years to 35 years) and resetting the interest rate of the loan from 0.25% to to 2%.  This debt rescheduling is captured in Project ID#58340.    Around the time of the rescheduling, the Republic of Congo was facing a balance of payment crisis and it decided to concession the RN1 through a toll-operate-transfer (TOT) privatization. The concession was won by La Congolaise des Routes S.A. (LCR), a joint venture between CSCEC (70% ownership stake), Egis Projects (15% ownership stake) and the Congolese Government (15% ownership stake). As of March 2019, LCR operated the RN1 through a 30-year franchise agreement. According to Li Jiqin, Chairman of CSCEC International, CSCEC reached out to the Republic of Congo for this deal because the NR1 was left unmaintained after its construction was completed in 2016.  Under this new agreement, CSCEC is responsible for maintaining the road while the French company, Egis, is responsible for managing toll collection. The CSCEC’s upfront equity investment in this public-private partnership (PPP) helped the Republic of Congo address its balance of payments crisis. The Republic of Congo also tried to convince the CSCEC to invest in a similar TOT privatization of National Route 2 (which was also constructed with financial support from China Eximbank), but the company declined as it believed the deal would not generate enough profit. 1.

Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021.

The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans. 1. The Chinese project title is 加纳布维水电站项目. 2. The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Bui Dam Construction Project is CH-GH-BUI-2007.  The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project is CH-GH-BUI-2013. 3. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the aggregate value of the two supplementary China Eximbank loans as Gh-DCMIS as $168,400,000 rather than $151,600,000. The Gh-DCMIS also identifies the loan commitment date as January 29, 2013 rather than April 30, 2012. These issues warrant further investigation. 4. Loan repayment for the BCL involved a cocoa sales agreement between Genertec Corporation of China and the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) for up to 30,000 metric tons of cocoa beans per year until the dam became operational. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were placed in an escrow account with China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational, the cocoa agreement ended and 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Any excess funds in the escrow account could be withdrawn by Government Ghana, or they could stay in the account and earn interest. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to fall within a range of $0.035 and $0.055 cents per kilowatt-hour (kW/h). According to the World Bank, the average electricity tariff in Africa is much higher — at $0.13 per kW/h. 5. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Bui Dam Construction Project as December 2, 2013. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 25, 2007 and September 1, 2012, respectively. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project as December 31, 2017. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 29, 2013 and December 2, 2013, respectively. 6.

30087,"China Eximbank provides RMB 200 million government concessional loan for Cape Coast Kotokuraba Market Project On November 22, 2012, the China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed an RMB 200 million ($32,060,000) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Cape Coast Kotokuraba Market Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest, and a 0.75% commitment fee. The final maturity date of the GCL is September 21, 2031.    According to the terms of the loan agreement with China Eximbank, the borrower was to use the proceeds from the operation of the new Kotokuraba Market to repay the loan. A special account was established at the Bank of Ghana where the proceeds from the operation of the new Kotokuraba Market could be deposited and accessed by China Eximbank. The proceeds from the GCL were also on-lent from the Government of Ghana to Cape Coast Metropolitan Assembly (CCMA), a Ghanaian state-owned enterprise. To this end, a subsidiary loan agreement was signed by the Government of Ghana and CCMA on January 24, 2013. This subsidiary loan also carried an 2% interest rate, and according to the terms of the subsidiary loan agreement, CCMA is responsible for repaying the Government of Ghana the disbursed principal amount of the loan in semi-annual installments commencing on the first payment date in 2017 and ending on the last date of payment in 2042.   According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $32,060,000 loan (GCL) achieved a 96.8% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 10 loan disbursements (worth $31,042,626.45) between 2016 and 2019: a $8,195,000.00 disbursement (for Invoice No. 1) on October 13, 2013, a $4,787,669.24 disbursement (for Invoice No. 2) on May 13, 2014, a $1,942,494.84 disbursement (for Invoice No. 3) on April 29, 2015, a $1,115,684.99 disbursement (for Invoice No. 4) on June 11, 2015, a $2,004,333.97 disbursement (for Invoice No. 5) on October 6, 2015, a $1,647,611.57 disbursement (for Invoice No. 6) on March 23, 2016, a $2,165,317.75 disbursement (for Invoice No. 7) on August 16, 2016, a $4,617,749.17 disbursement (for Invoice No. 8) on December 29, 2017, a $3,425,760.30 disbursement (for Invoice No. 9) on April 17, 2018, and a $1,141,004.62 disbursement (for Invoice No. 10) on January 31, 2019.

30709,"China Eximbank provides additional $76.2 million buyer’s credit loan for Bui Dam Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#183, #30801, #30086, #95483, #95484) On September 25, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $293,506,062 for the Bui Dam Construction Project. Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021.

The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans. 1. The Chinese project title is 加纳布维水电站项目. 2. The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Bui Dam Construction Project is CH-GH-BUI-2007.  The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project is CH-GH-BUI-2013.3. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the aggregate value of the two supplementary China Eximbank loans as Gh-DCMIS as $168,400,000 rather than $151,600,000. The Gh-DCMIS also identifies the loan commitment date as January 29, 2013 rather than April 30, 2012. These issues warrant further investigation. 4. Loan repayment for the BCL involved a cocoa sales agreement between Genertec Corporation of China and the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) for up to 30,000 metric tons of cocoa beans per year until the dam became operational. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were placed in an escrow account with China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational, the cocoa agreement ended and 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Any excess funds in the escrow account could be withdrawn by Government Ghana, or they could stay in the account and earn interest. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to fall within a range of $0.035 and $0.055 cents per kilowatt-hour (kW/h). According to the World Bank, the average electricity tariff in Africa is much higher — at $0.13 per kW/h. 5. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Bui Dam Construction Project as December 2, 2013. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 25, 2007 and September 1, 2012, respectively. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project as December 31, 2017. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 29, 2013 and December 2, 2013, respectively. 6.

58586,"China Development Bank provides $850 million loan for Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Development Project (Linked to Project ID#2034, #60039, #85282) On December 16, 2011, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a $3 billion master facility agreement (captured via Project ID#2034). This agreement established two lending facilities: Tranche A and Tranche B.  Tranche A is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, a 0.25% upfront fee, and a 1% commitment fee. Tranche B is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 10 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee. Both tranches are collateralized against cash proceeds from the sale of crude oil from the Jubilee field, which the borrower was required to deposit in a debt service reserve account (DSRA). The cash balance of the DSRA was GHS 370,586,909 ($71,266,713) in 2019.  [Note: A requirement of the master facility agreement was that the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co. (UNIPEC Asia) sign an offtaker for the sale and purchase of crude oil. Under the terms of this agreement, GNPC agreed to supply and sell 13,000 barrels of crude oil from Jubilee Field each day to UNIPEC Asia over a 15.5 year period. The proceeds from these oil sales were then deposited into a special account to facilitate loan repayment and provide a source of collateral.]   Under the terms of the master facility agreement, subsidiary loan agreements must be negotiated to secure financial support for any given project. Tranche A is captured in #2034 and Tranche B is captured in #85282.   On June 13, 2012, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed an $850 million subsidiary loan agreement — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Development Project (WCGIDP). The Government of Ghana then used the proceeds from this CDB loan to on-lend to Ghana National Gas Company, which is a state-owned enterprise that is responsible for operating infrastructure required for the gathering, processing, transporting and marketing of natural gas resources in Ghana.   This project involved the construction of a natural gas processing plant in Atuabo that is capable of processing 150 million standard cubic feet of raw natural gas a day, a 36 km shallow-water offshore pipeline from Jubilee Field to the natural gas processing plant in Atuabo, a 120 km onshore pipeline from the gas processing plant in Atuabo within Ellembelle District to a thermal power station in Aboadze (Aboazi) in the Takoradi metropolis, a 75­ km lean gas lateral onshore pipeline from Esiama to Prestea, a natural gas liquids export system in Domunli, a jetty for the export of natural gas liquids, a truck loading gantry, an offshore loading facility, and an operations & control office complex in Alabokazo. The WCGIDP is designed to generate employment, new infrastructure and economic growth for Ghana while providing electricity to the public at a much lower cost and enhancing the competitiveness of the country’s industries.  The project also supports the nation’s goal to become a petroleum-processing hub and a preferred exporter of power in western Africa.   Sinopec International Petroleum Services Corporation (SIPSC) was the contractor responsible for project  implementation. The project commenced in July 2011. By the close of 2012, 104 km out of the 111 km onshore pipeline had been laid, 95% of earthworks at the Atuabo natural gas processing plant site were complete, the fabrication of equipment packages for the gas processing plant and some critical packages such as pressure regulating package and fuel gas package were near completion, approximately 8 km out of the 45 km offshore shallow water pipeline was laid. $598.95 million of the $850 million loan was disbursed by the end of 2013.  On September 16, 2015, the Atuabo natural gas processing plant was officially handed over to the Ghanaian authorities.  1. This project is also known as the Atuabo Gas Project. The Chinese project title is 西部走廊天然气基础设施发展项目 or 加纳西部走廊天然气工 or 天然气基础设施建设项目 or 加纳天然气工程项目. The Atuabo Natural Gas Processing Plant is referred to as 阿图阿博天然气处理厂. 2.

The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 443,187,554.60. The borrowing terms of the GCL, which is captured via Project ID#30384, were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 6.5 year grace period, and a 20.5 year maturity. This loan was scheduled for repayment in semi-annual installments beginning on March 21, 2019 and ending on March 21, 2033.  The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 16,812,445.00 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 33,624,890.00 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).

On May 19, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a supplemental GCL agreement worth RMB 650 million ($98,650,000) for the same project. This GCL, which is captured via Project ID#47014, carried a 19.6-year maturity (final maturity date: September 21, 2035) and a 2% interest rate. Its grace period is unknown.  The lender made disbursements worth RMB 55,884,448.34 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 45,038,186.77 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 519,103,407.17 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 574,987,855.51 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 620,026,042.28 as of June 30, 2022.   The proceeds of both GCLs were to be used by the borrower to finance one or more commercial contracts with Huawei Technologies. Co. Ltd. The purpose of the project was to construct 2100 km of national optic fibre backbone infrastructure, which passes through eight major towns and 36 districts.   Huawei Technologies. Co. Ltd is the general contractor responsible for project implementation. However, the Government of Kenya’s State Department is also implementing the project in conjunction with Information and Communications Technology Authority (ICTA). Construction began on September 22, 2014. According to the Kenyan Aid Management Platform, the NOFBI project was originally expected to reach completion by June 30, 2016. However, as of February 2021, the project was still not complete.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the NOFBI and E-Government Expansion Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a Kenyan government audit, ‘the NOFBI project network has been operational since 2014 and has been used by most of the data service providers in the [c]ountry. However, although the financing agreement [with China Eximbank] indicated that the Government [of Kenya] would sell out excess capacity commercially to the public and bill them to finance the loan repayments, there has been no billing done over the last five […] years it has been in operation. Further, the Service Provision Framework Agreement between the NOFBI Project Managers and the Internet Service Providers has not been implemented. The Government [of Kenya] has, therefore, been funding the operations of commercial entities without recovering the cost which amounts to lack of prudent use of public resources. In addition, no records have been provided detailing the users that have been connected to NOFBI for the last five […] years, their utilization levels, and the amount payable by each.'   This project has also become a target of parliamentary scrutiny and controversy. On May 11, 2021, James Opiyo Wandayi, a member of the Kenyan parliament, said ‘[d]uring this financial year that we are reviewing, the case of National Optic Fibre Backbone Infrastructure (NOFBI) came to us. This is a project which, of course, was well intended, and I still believe it is well intended even as we speak. It is a project that has cost taxpayers a [whopping] Kshs21 billion and still counting. This is because the last phase of it is still under implementation. This is one project that was conceived and implemented in the most opaque manner and in blatant disregard of the existing laws. If you look at the first phase of this project, it cost taxpayers Kshs4.2 billion. For those who do not know, this is the project that was supposed to enhance internet connectivity across the country. It was supposed to lay down the trunks, infrastructure, and highways for internet from Nairobi to the countryside. The first phase of this project cost taxpayers Kshs4.2 billion and it was, indeed, fully funded by the Government of Kenya. There was some attempt to undertake an open tendering process and, as a result of this, three companies were contracted. These were Huawei, a company from China and two other local companies. They were contracted to undertake that project. However, when that project entered the second phase, which cost taxpayers Kshs7.2 billion, there is no evidence how the company that was eventually contracted was ever contracted. There was no evidence how that company came on board. We have laboured through and through to find out how that company came on board. Incidentally, the same company did the first phase - that is Huawei Technologies. We were at pains to understand how a contract of Kshs7.2 billion could have been awarded to a company on the basis of nothing really. There was no open tendering, no direct procurement as we know it under the law, and there was no restricted tendering. They were citing some nebulous terminology of government-to-government tendering procurement process, which is not known in any law. Moreover, it is an issue that is still left pending. However, even more seriously, the same company was awarded another contract to implement the third phase of this project, now at a [whopping] Kshs9.8 billion. This is what they are calling Phase 2 expansion of the NOFBI Project. Still, we are unable to find out how that company was awarded that contract and how it was procured. Indeed, for both Phase 2 and Phase 2 expansion of this project, the company that was awarded the contract was unable to produce even a letter of award. We struggled to get the letter of award that was given to the company. We could not lay our hands on any. Nobody was willing to go on record that they are responsible for the procurement of this company. Therefore, that is just one example. However, just to conclude on that particular aspect of NOFBI Project, there was the matter of revenues that would then be generated from this project, especially Phase 1 which was completed. There was some [loose] agreement that was purportedly entered into between the Information, Communication and Technology Ministry and Telkom Kenya that would allow Telkom Kenya to be collecting revenue as it carries out maintenance on the infrastructure. However, the profits that would be realised would then be channeled to an escrow account, which would then help the country and the public to pay back the loans that were procured from China. As we speak, eight or so years down the line, no single cent has been deposited in the escrow account. It therefore means that the public is going to continue to carry this burden of the debt from other sources and yet, there is money that is being generated from that project. This is because we know - and there was evidence - that Telkom Kenya was charging the commercial data service providers such as Safaricom, Orange and many others. Therefore, when Telkom Kenya came before us, they were not shy. They just told us: “It is true we have been collecting money.” Indeed, they admitted that they had by that time collected up to about Kshs1.7 billion. However, they were not going to remit anything to the Government of Kenya on account of the fact that the costs they had incurred in maintaining this infrastructure was more than what they had collected. However, there was no independent authority or entity that had audited their accounts with regard to this revenue collection from the NOFBI infrastructure.’ 1. This project is also known as the Kenya National Fibre Backbone Infrastructure II (NOFBI II ) Expansion Project. The Chinese project title is 肯尼亚国家光纤宽带基础设施项目. 2.

The BCL, which was finalized after the Government of Portugal failed to fulfill its 2010 commitment to finance the bridge, carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 4%.   The Government of Mozambique agreed to collect toll revenue to repay the loan.

(captured via Project ID#57131). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure in support of the loan.  The Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project involved the construction of a 3 kilometer long and 48 meter high suspension bridge that connects the cities of Maputo and Katembe.

This loan agreement was then ratified by the Government of Mozambique’s Council of Ministers on February 28, 2012. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The Maputo Ring Road Project involved the construction and upgrading of six road sections over 74 kilometers. These road sections include: (1) 6.325 km expansion of Avenida da Marginal from Hotel Radisson to Costa do Sol; (2) 19.869 km construction of road from Costa do Sol to Marracuene; (3) 10.506 km construction of road from Chiango to Zimpeto; (4) 15.5 km expansion of the national road N1 from Zimpeto to Marracuene; (5) 16.299 km construction of road from Zimpeto to Tchumene (including connection to N4); and the (6) 5.5 km construction of a road from the Machava node to Praça 16 de Junho (including connection to Avenida 24 de Julho).  In total, the project involved 52 kilometers of new road construction, 22 kilometers of road upgrading work, and the construction or rehabilitation of 6 bridges and 3 interchanges. It is a two-way four-lane highway with double asphalt concrete pavement and a design speed of 60–80 km per hour. It allows commuters to bypass the existing N1 and N4 road. It also includes tolls and sidewalks.   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 7, 2012 and a foundation stone laying ceremony took place on September 20, 2012. The project was originally expected to take 2 and a half years to execute. Construction was expected to be completed no later than December 2014. However, the project encountered various delays and problems during implementation (including a strike by construction workers in 2014). The implementation of the project and its management were handed over to Maputo Development Corporation (Maputo-Sul), a public company, in December 2014. The project was ultimately completed on December 29, 2015.   Centro de Integridade Pública (CIP) and Chr. Michelsen Institute (CMI) claim that the commercial contract for the Maputo Ring Road Project, which was issued to CRBC without a tender, was overpriced by $40 million and plagued by corruption.  Whereas the actual unit cost of constructing each kilometer of the road was $5 million, the market-determined unit cost of constructing each kilometer of the road would have been $2.5 million to $3 million. CIP and CMI also claim that the quality of the Maputo Ring Road is poor and vulnerable to erosion along at least two-thirds of its length.  Tolls on the Maputo ring road, contested by Mozambican civil society organizations, were charged beginning on February 1, 2022.  At that time, Rede Viária de Moçambique (Revimo) -- the concession company created in September 2018 and made responsible for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge, the Maputo Ring Road and the EN6 (Beira-Machipanda) Road in December 2019 -- charged tolls for use of the Maputo Ring Road ranging from 40 meticais (55 euro cents) for light vehicles to 580 meticais (€8) for heavy vehicles, with discounts of up to 75% for public transport and 60% for frequent users. CIP claimed at the time that Mozambicans could refuse to pay the tolls, alleging 'unconstitutionality and illegalities.' Another Mozambican NGO, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), challenged the role of (Revimo) and advocated the revocation of the Maputo Ring Road concession. CDD questioned the interests of the concession company, stating that people 'do not know its organizational structure and the circumstances in which it was created.'  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Maputo Ring Road Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

Then, the Chinese Government commissioned the Shanghai Architectural Research and Design Institute to inspect this project between 12-29 March 2012. Following the results of the inspection, on 20 December 2012, the Chinese Government signed an economic and technical cooperation project (ETCA) providing a RMB 120 million interest-free loan for the Friendship Hall Renovation Project as well as a 180 million RMB grant for unspecified projects (see ETCA #30433). The total project cost was RMB 186 million, but it is not known how the additional RMB 66 million was financed.  This project involved the renovation and maintenance of the conference building, conference hall, banquet hall, exhibition hall, and theater in Friendship Hall. China Railway 4th Bureau was the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 29 November 2014 and this project was completed in August 2017.  The Friendship Hall was originally constructed with Chinese aid during the 1970s.

Two loans were issued to Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance: a $275 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 430 basis points, a 1.83-year (22 month) grace period, and a 12.83-year (154 month) maturity and a $920 million preferential’s buyer’s credit (PBC) with a 20-year maturity, a 7-year (84 month) grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The PBC (captured via Project ID#59752) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 84 months from the first loan disbursement date (June 20, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 156 months from the end of the grace period. The BCL (captured via Project ID#59733) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 22 months from the first loan disbursement date (July 24, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 132 months from the end of the grace period.  The PBC and BCL proceeds were on-lent from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance to the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), which in turn used the proceeds to finance a September 2011 commercial (EPC) contract with China Petroleum Technology and Development Corporation (CPTDC), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company (CNPC).  The PBC and BCL were both secured with (i.e. collateralized against) all rights under a natural gas sales agreement between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) and TPDC. The borrower (Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance) and end-user (TPDC) was required to deposit profits from the gas pipeline into three Stanbic Bank escrow accounts that were accessible to the lender. According to TPDC’s audited financial statements, the escrow accounts ‘were opened to secure repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under the loan agreements’ and the minimum cash balances in these accounts functioned as sources of ‘collateral’. TPDC and Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance maintained a cash balance of TZS 42,011,517,702 in the escrow accounts as of June 30, 2014, TZS 120,509,276,347 as of June 30, 2015 (TZS 2,380,765,097 from TPDC and TZS 118,128,511,250 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 (TZS 131,473,427,000) as of June 30, 2016 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 as of June 30, 2017, $60,320,710 (TZS 136,713,000,000) as of June 30, 2018, $60,320,710 (TZS 138,105,000,000) as of June 30, 2019 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), $60,320,710 (TZS 138,527,000,000) as of June 30, 2020 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), and $60,320,710 (TZS 138,673,000,000) as of June 30, 2021 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance).

As of June 30, 2021, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had not made any principal or interest payments on the BCL to the Government of Tanzania (despite the fact that the BCL’s grace period expired on May 24, 2015).  The gas pipeline project was designed and constructed to deliver natural gas to Dar es Salaam for use in power generation, industrial applications, household cooking and in propulsion of transport vehicles. It involved the construction of a 542 kilometer marine and terrestrial pipeline between Songo Songo and Dar Es Salaam as well as two processing plants: one in Songo Songo and another in Mnazi Bay.   The 542-kilometer gas pipeline has four parts: (i) 290-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Madimba in Mtwara to Somanga Fungu; (ii) 25-kilometer marine pipeline of 24-inches from Songo Songo Island to Somanga Fungu; (iii) 197-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Somanga Fungu to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam; and (iv) 30-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 16-inches diameter from Kinyerezi to Tegeta in Dar es Salaam. It passes through 1 marine park, 4 regions, 8 districts, 41 wards and 113 villages. The capacity of the main (36 inch) pipeline is rated at 784 million standard cubic feet per day, according to the Natural Gas Utilization Master Plan 2016-2045, but can handle up to 1002 million standard cubic feet per day with compression. It is the longest gas pipeline that has ever been constructed in Tanzania.  CPTDC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction was officially launched on November 8, 2012 and the Tanzanian President inaugurated the constructed pipeline on October 10, 2015. The pipeline was originally scheduled for a completion date in 2014.   Loan repayment was originally expected to depend on gas sales upon completion of the pipeline construction and after the project's commercial operation date (COD). However, a review of the on-lending agreements, Gas Sales Agreements (GSA), and pipeline construction contract revealed that the pipeline was constructed before pre-identification and pre-signing of gas sales agreements between Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and its expected major gas customers. This anomaly had an effect on loan repayment as actual gas sales came in far below the initial projection of 138.8 million standard cubic feet per day. In fact, according to a report published by the Government of Tanzania's Controller and Auditor General (CAG), TANESCO was the only gas consumer as of March 2017 -- with a consumption average of 46.61 million standard cubic feet per day instead of the agreed amount of at least 80 million standard cubic feet per day as per the GSA between TPDC and TANESCO.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loans that were issued for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the original expectations of the lender. Tanzania's National Audit Office (NAO) warned of 'Financial Distress Facing TPDC Due to Non-Settlement of TANESCO Long Outstanding Bills TZS 248 Billion' in its Annual General Report on the Audit of Public Authorities and other Bodies for the financial year 2016/2017. More specifically, the NAO noted that 'TPDC and TANESCO entered into a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in September 2015 whereby the TANESCO buys natural gas from TPDC for power generation at Kinyerezi, Ubungo II and Symbion Power Plants. I have noted that between September 2015 and December 2017 monthly invoices totaling to TZS 567,514,961,312.95. (USD 254,448,796.08), were issued by TPDC to TANESCO with respects to the natural gas supplied to TANESCO for power generation. My audit noted that by December 2017, TANESCO had managed to settle TZS 318,904,743,618.61 (USD 142,982,887.87) equivalent to 56% of the total amount of invoices leaving TZS 248,610,217,694.34 (USD 111,465,908.21) unsettled. TPDC may not be able to service the loan obtained to facilitate construction of Mtwara-Dar Gas Pipeline from EXIM Bank of China and their respective interests, if TANESCO does not settle this liability. Failure to repay the loan shall subject the Corporation to a compounded interest of 0.8% charged on the unpaid loan balance which will increase financial cost to TPDC and the Government. Further, failure to pay the loan shall amount to transfer of TPDC rights under the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) to EXIM Bank of China as per Clause 2 of the Security Assignment Contractual Rights which forms of the Agreement signed between TPDC and EXIM Bank of China. The Government through Ministry of Finance and Planning and Ministry of Energy should consider assisting TANESCO in their efforts to settle such long outstanding dues which in turn will help TPDC meet gas purchase and other operational costs.' TPDC’s audited financial statements also indicate that, as the ultimate borrower/end user, it had fallen into arrears by 2017/2018. TPDC’s audited financial statements for the year ending on June 30, 2018 note that China Eximbank withdrew $19,806 from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 as a penalty for the borrower’s ‘late repayment of [a] due installment’. Then, in June 2019, TPDC announced that it was still having difficulty servicing its debts to the Government of Tanzania and it began to lobby for ‘debt relief’ — that is, for the Government of Tanzania to shoulder the responsibility of loan repayment instead of TPDC. 1. This project is also known as the Mtwara–Dar es Salaam Natural Gas Pipeline Project or MDNGP Project. The Chinese project title is 姆特瓦拉至达累斯萨拉姆的天然气管道项目.2. Several sources describe this BCL as commercial or non-concessional in nature, but AidData's methodology classifies loans as concessional if they have a 25% or greater grant element. Since this BCL has a 27% grant element, AidData has categorized it as concessional.3. AidData has estimated the BCL’s all-in interest rate (5.036%) by 4.3% to average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 (0.736%).4. In the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, a single $1.2 billion China Eximbank loan is recorded for this project. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it records a $919 million concessional loan (with a 33-year maturity and a 2% interest rate) and a $245 million commercial loan (with unknown borrowing terms) from China Eximbank for this project. AidData relies on the face values and borrowing terms of the loans that are recorded in the audited financial statements of Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC): a $275 million buyer’s credit loan from China Eximbank (with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.3% margin, a 1.83-year grace period, and 12.83-year maturity) and a $920 million preferential buyer’s credit from China Eximbank (with a 2% interest rate, 7-year grace period, and 20-year maturity). 5. TANESCO is a Tanzanian parastatal organization established in 1964. It is wholly owned by the Government of Tanzania through its Ministry of Energy and Minerals.6. The three escrow accounts are governed by an Escrow Accounts Management Agreement between China Eximbank, Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance, PPDC, and Stanbic Bank. TPDC’s audited financial statements notes that the funds deposited in the escrow accounts are classified under non-current assets since they are not available for meeting immediate short-term financial obligations of TBPDC during the period of the China Eximbank loans.7. The project’s total cost turned out to be $1.3 billion with TPDC and the Government of Tanzania accruing some significant unforeseen costs.8.

In September 2014, Wentworth Resources and TPDC signed a gas sales agreement (GSA), covering the long-term sale of natural gas from the Mnazi Bay and Msimbati fields. Wentworth Resources was responsible for supplying TPDC with up to 130 mmcfd of gas for 17 years. The gas was to be supplied via the TPDC-owned and -operated Mtwara to Dar es Salaam pipeline and Madimba central processing facility. The purchase point was the pipeline connecting existing Mnazi Bay gas production facility to TPDC-owned Madimba Gas Processing Plant.10.

The gas pipeline project was designed and constructed to deliver natural gas to Dar es Salaam for use in power generation, industrial applications, household cooking and in propulsion of transport vehicles. It involved the construction of a 542 kilometer marine and terrestrial pipeline between Songo Songo and Dar Es Salaam as well as two processing plants: one in Songo Songo and another in Mnazi Bay.   The 542-kilometer gas pipeline has four parts: (i) 290-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Madimba in Mtwara to Somanga Fungu; (ii) 25-kilometer marine pipeline of 24-inches from Songo Songo Island to Somanga Fungu; (iii) 197-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Somanga Fungu to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam; and (iv) 30-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 16-inches diameter from Kinyerezi to Tegeta in Dar es Salaam. It passes through 1 marine park, 4 regions, 8 districts, 41 wards and 113 villages. The capacity of the main (36 inch) pipeline is rated at 784 million standard cubic feet per day, according to the Natural Gas Utilization Master Plan 2016-2045, but can handle up to 1002 million standard cubic feet per day with compression. It is the longest gas pipeline that has ever been constructed in Tanzania.  CPTDC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction was officially launched on November 8, 2012 and the Tanzanian President inaugurated the constructed pipeline on October 10, 2015. The pipeline was originally scheduled for a completion date in 2014.   Loan repayment was originally expected to depend on gas sales upon completion of the pipeline construction and after the project's commercial operation date (COD). However, a review of the on-lending agreements, Gas Sales Agreements (GSA), and pipeline construction contract revealed that the pipeline was constructed before pre-identification and pre-signing of gas sales agreements between Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and its expected major gas customers. This anomaly had an effect on loan repayment as actual gas sales came in far below the initial projection of 138.8 million standard cubic feet per day. In fact, according to a report published by the Government of Tanzania's Controller and Auditor General (CAG), TANESCO was the only gas consumer as of March 2017 -- with a consumption average of 46.61 million standard cubic feet per day instead of the agreed amount of at least 80 million standard cubic feet per day as per the GSA between TPDC and TANESCO.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loans that were issued for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the original expectations of the lender. Tanzania's National Audit Office (NAO) warned of 'Financial Distress Facing TPDC Due to Non-Settlement of TANESCO Long Outstanding Bills TZS 248 Billion' in its Annual General Report on the Audit of Public Authorities and other Bodies for the financial year 2016/2017. More specifically, the NAO noted that 'TPDC and TANESCO entered into a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in September 2015 whereby the TANESCO buys natural gas from TPDC for power generation at Kinyerezi, Ubungo II and Symbion Power Plants. I have noted that between September 2015 and December 2017 monthly invoices totaling to TZS 567,514,961,312.95. (USD 254,448,796.08), were issued by TPDC to TANESCO with respects to the natural gas supplied to TANESCO for power generation. My audit noted that by December 2017, TANESCO had managed to settle TZS 318,904,743,618.61 (USD 142,982,887.87) equivalent to 56% of the total amount of invoices leaving TZS 248,610,217,694.34 (USD 111,465,908.21) unsettled. TPDC may not be able to service the loan obtained to facilitate construction of Mtwara-Dar Gas Pipeline from EXIM Bank of China and their respective interests, if TANESCO does not settle this liability. Failure to repay the loan shall subject the Corporation to a compounded interest of 0.8% charged on the unpaid loan balance which will increase financial cost to TPDC and the Government. Further, failure to pay the loan shall amount to transfer of TPDC rights under the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) to EXIM Bank of China as per Clause 2 of the Security Assignment Contractual Rights which forms of the Agreement signed between TPDC and EXIM Bank of China. The Government through Ministry of Finance and Planning and Ministry of Energy should consider assisting TANESCO in their efforts to settle such long outstanding dues which in turn will help TPDC meet gas purchase and other operational costs.' TPDC’s audited financial statements also indicate that, as the ultimate borrower/end user, it had fallen into arrears by 2017/2018. TPDC’s audited financial statements for the year ending on June 30, 2018 note that China Eximbank withdrew $19,806 from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 as a penalty for the borrower’s ‘late repayment of [a] due installment’. Then, in June 2019, TPDC announced that it was still having difficulty servicing its debts to the Government of Tanzania and it began to lobby for ‘debt relief’ — that is, for the Government of Tanzania to shoulder the responsibility of loan repayment instead of TPDC. 1. This project is also known as the Mtwara–Dar es Salaam Natural Gas Pipeline Project or MDNGP Project. The Chinese project title is 姆特瓦拉至达累斯萨拉姆的天然气管道项目.2. Several sources describe this BCL as commercial or non-concessional in nature, but AidData's methodology classifies loans as concessional if they have a 25% or greater grant element. Since this BCL has a 27% grant element, AidData has categorized it as concessional.3. AidData has estimated the BCL’s all-in interest rate (5.036%) by 4.3% to average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 (0.736%).4. In the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, a single $1.2 billion China Eximbank loan is recorded for this project. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it records a $919 million concessional loan (with a 33-year maturity and a 2% interest rate) and a $245 million commercial loan (with unknown borrowing terms) from China Eximbank for this project. AidData relies on the face values and borrowing terms of the loans that are recorded in the audited financial statements of Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC): a $275 million buyer’s credit loan from China Eximbank (with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.3% margin, a 1.83-year grace period, and 12.83-year maturity) and a $920 million preferential buyer’s credit from China Eximbank (with a 2% interest rate, 7-year grace period, and 20-year maturity).5. TANESCO is a Tanzanian parastatal organization established in 1964. It is wholly owned by the Government of Tanzania through its Ministry of Energy and Minerals.6. The three escrow accounts are governed by an Escrow Accounts Management Agreement between China Eximbank, Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance, PPDC, and Stanbic Bank. TPDC’s audited financial statements notes that the funds deposited in the escrow accounts are classified under non-current assets since they are not available for meeting immediate short-term financial obligations of TBPDC during the period of the China Eximbank loans.7. The project’s total cost turned out to be $1.3 billion with TPDC and the Government of Tanzania accruing some significant unforeseen costs.8.

Wentworth Resources was responsible for supplying TPDC with up to 130 mmcfd of gas for 17 years. The gas was to be supplied via the TPDC-owned and -operated Mtwara to Dar es Salaam pipeline and Madimba central processing facility.

Then, on January 16, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Togo signed a $75 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement and a $75 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement the project. The GCL and PBC carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 1.8728% interest rate, 7.526-year grace period, and a 20.026-year maturity. Both loans were to be serviced and secured with revenues from an airport infrastructure development fee (known as 'RDIA' in French).    The proceeds from the PBC and GCL were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Togo’s Ministry of Transport and China Airport Construction Group Corporation (CACC), which was signed in December 2010. The GCL is captured via Project ID#73836 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#46970.    Phase 1 involved the construction of a new terminal, a shopping center, and a hotel at the Gnassingbé Eyadéma International Airport (AIGE), as well as the construction of a car park with 1,000 spaces; and an expansion of the freight area. It also included extending the runway by 500 meters, extending the taxiway, reconstruction the existing runway and its drain, renovating and extending the energy stems, the airfield's lights, navigation and meteorological systems, and a transformer substation. Three boarding bridges were also to be constructed. The 21,000 square meter terminal building was located on the north side of the current terminal, 2.3 times the size of ​​the current terminal.

The loan (PBC) carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 1.8728% interest rate, 7.526-year grace period, and a 20.026-year maturity. The proceeds of the loan were on-lent by the Government of Togo to the Communauté Electrique du Bénin (CEB). CEB was an inter-governmental organization jointly owned by the Governments of Benin and Togo responsible for the power supply between the two countries. CEB used the loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract that it signed with TBEA Co., Ltd. on March 6, 2012.

Then, on August 2, 2009, CNPC President, Jiang Jiemin, and Chad’s Oil and Mineral Resources Minister, Mahamat Hassan Nasser, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to apply for a $330 million loan to support the implementation of the $1 billion project. On the same day, a Sino-Chadian joint venture agreement was signed to establish Société de Raffinage de N'Djaména (SRN) SA (恩贾梅纳炼厂有限公司 or 恩贾梅纳炼油公司), which is a special purpose vehicle that is jointly owned by CNPC (60% equity stake) and a Chadian state-owned enterprise called Société des Hydrocarbures du Tchad (SHT) (40% equity stake). Nearly two years later, in May 2011, China Eximbank and SRN SA signed a $330 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project (captured via Project ID#72356). The BCL, which was reportedly the first one ever issued by China Eximbank to an overseas joint venture, carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 300 basis points.  CNPC provided a repayment guarantee for 60% of the face value of the China Eximbank PBC and SHT provided a repayment guarantee to cover the remaining 40% of the face value of the PBC. CNPC and SHT also pledged their respective shares in Société de Raffinage de N'Djaména (SRN) SA as sources of collateral.  Sinosure refused to insure the BCL, which it deemed too risky. Additionally, CNPC Finance (HK) Limited issued a loan worth approximately $70 million to SRN SA in May 2011 (captured via Project ID#91918). The borrowing terms of the loan from CNPC Finance (HK) Limited are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank BCL and the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan were used to fund SHT’s equity contribution (worth approximately 40% of $1 billion) to Société de Raffinage de N'Djaména (SRN) SA.   The N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project had two components: the construction of an oil refinery in Djarmaya that is located to the north of N'Djamena and capable of producing 20,000 to 60,000 barrels a day; and the construction of a 311 km pipeline connecting the Rônier and Mimosa oilfields in Bongor Basin (in eastern-central) Chad to the refinery in Djarmaya (Note: Block H of the Rônier oil field is fully owned by CNPC).   The contractor responsible for project implementation was PetroChina Engineering Construction, which is a subsidiary of PetroChina. Project implementation commenced on October 26, 2008 and reached completion on June 29, 2011. Then, on July 10, 2011, the refinery produced its first batch of diesel fuel. In January 2012, the Government of Chad suspended the oil refinery deal with CNPC and announced that it would expel the Chinese director of the refinery and renegotiate the deal. Disagreements over fuel prices had caused the relationship between the joint venture partners to deteriorate. The refinery restarted operations in February 2012. However, in August 2013, the Government of Chad suspended CNPC’s operations in Chad, accusing CNPC of violating environmental standards at the company’s Rônier oilfield. Work resumed shortly thereafter but was halted again in May 2014, after CNPC refused to pay a $1.2 billion fine. Preparing to take the dispute to international arbitration, the Government of Chad in October 2014 threatened to revoke and re-auction CNPC’s oil exploration licenses.  The dispute was settled the same month when CNPC agreed to pay a $400 million fine and concede to the Government of Chad a 10% stake in existing oil operations in the country, as well as a 25% stake in future oil operations. In exchange, the arbitration case was dropped and CNPC was permitted to export oil through the Chad-Cameroon pipeline.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  After a sharp decline in oil prices in 2014-2015, Chad experienced an economic recession and a debt crisis and Société de Raffinage de N’djamena (SRN) SA sought to renegotiate the borrowing terms of the China Eximbank loan for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project. A rescheduling agreement was finalized in April 2017: China Eximbank agreed to the lengthen the maturity of the loan and reschedule arrears that had accumulated (as captured via Project ID#55744). It appears that China Eximbank did not require the accumulated arrears to be repaid before rescheduling the maturity of the loan. 1. N'Djamena Refinery is sometimes called the Djermaya Refinery or the Rônier Oil Refinery. Consequently. this project is also known as the Rônier Oil Refinery And Pipeline Project or Djermaya Oil Refinery And Pipeline Project. The Chinese project title is 中石油Roinier油田项目 or 于乍得恩贾梅纳炼厂项目 or 恩贾梅纳炼油厂 or 乍得炼油厂 or 恩贾梅纳炼油 or 乍得炼厂项.  The Arabic project title is مصفاة جرماية. The French project title is Raffinerie de Djarmaya or projet CNPC-SRN. 2. It is unclear if the development of the oil wells in the Rônier 1, Rônier 4, Rônier C1 and Mimosa 4 oilfields – close to the village of Koud Alwa, about 20 km to the south of the small town of Bousso — occurred with support from the China Eximbank PBC or a separate investment by CNPC. 3.  The all-in interest rate of the China Eximbank PBC was calculated as follows: 0.414% (average 6-month USD LIBOR rate in May 2011) + 3% (300 basis points) = 3.414%. 4. Neither the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan nor the China Eximbank PBC are recorded in the World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS). 5. The CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan is not captured in the Chinese Loans to Africa Database developed by SAIS-CARI and maintained by the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University. However, its existence has been independently verified by the IMF and EITI. The face value of the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan is unknown. However, given that the total cost of the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project is $1 billion and Société des Hydrocarbures du Tchad (SHT) sought to finance its 40% equity stake in the project company (SRN SA) with debt, AidData assumes that the face value of the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan was roughly equivalent to the difference ($70 million) between $400 million and the $330 million PBC that was issued to SRN SA. This issue warrants further investigation. Further research is also needed to determine if the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited was supported by any credit enhancements. 6. Construction of the N'Djamena (Djarmaya) refinery was part of the first phase of CNPC’s upstream and downstream integrated project in Chad, which also included construction of the Rônier oilfield and a 311 km pipeline between the refinery and the oilfield. Project ID#72355 captures the surface engineering and pipeline work at the Rônier oilfied, while Project ID#56285 details the Rônier road construction, as the road was used for delivering supplies to the oil refinery construction site upon completion. 7. Several sources suggest that the $330 million loan was issued in the form of a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) rather than a BCL and that it was the first PBC ever issued by China Eximbank to an overseas joint venture. However, since the loan's interest rate was floating rather than fixed, AidData has coded the loan as a BCL for the time being. This issue warrants further investigation.",True,0.8374517

This framework agreement (captured via Project ID#60219) was ratified on October 26, 2006.   Two of the subsidiary loans that were approved through the framework agreement included a $81 million loan in 2007 for Phase 1 of the Maya-Maya International Airport Project (captured in Project ID#161) and a $72 million loan for Phase 2 of the Maya-Maya International Airport Project (captured in this project, ID#141). The borrowing terms of these loans were as follows: a 0.25% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The (principal) amount outstanding under these two loans was $10,880,885 as of December 31, 2019.    This project involved the construction and equipping of Maya-Maya International Airport Project in the capital city of Brazzaville. Phase 1 involved the construction of a terminal building (including viaducts and a parking lot with 800 spaces). Phase 2 involved the installation of runway equipment and the construction of an airport hotel and an aviation club.  Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative Co., Ltd (WIETC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases.

Phase 2 is sometimes also referred to as the Maya-Maya International Airport Equipment Project. 2. According to China Eximbank, it issued a buyer’s credit loan in support of Phase 1 of the Maya-Maya International Airport Project. The loan that supported this project was also approved as a subsidiary loan under the $1.6 billion, oil-backed loan framework agreement that China Eximbank and the Republic of Congo signed in 2006 (see Project ID#60219). However, it is unclear if this means that all of the subsidiary loans approved under that framework agreement were buyer’s credit loans. This issue merits further investigation.3.

The estimated borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: 19-year maturity, 4-year grace period, and a 0.25% interest rate. Its (principal) amount outstanding was $85,218,355 as of December 31, 2019.    The project involved the construction of a 19.2MW hydroelectric power plant — with three hydroelectric power generation units — on the Lengoué River in Mokéko district and the department of Sangha. The plant was designed with 3 sets of Francis vertical shaft suspension-type water-turbine generator units. It was meant to supply power to the neighboring towns of Ouesso and Mokéko and their surrounding localities via adjoining transmission lines.

The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the agreement on December 5, 2011. The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 2% interest rate, an 8-year grace period, and a 21-year maturity.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the loan achieved a 174% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 7 loan disbursements (worth ETB 2,988,235,879) between 2013 and 2015: an ETB 548,151,920 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 366,666,667 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 366,666,667 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 314,960,630 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 540,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 606,060,606 disbursement on January 8, 2015, and an ETB 245,729,390  disbursement on July 7, 2015.   The purpose of the project was to drill 24 water wells -- including three deep water wells in the Akaki well field areas -- and produce about 10,000 cubic meters of water per a day, thereby benefiting 100,000 people. The project also included 266.3 km of main line installation, 10.5 km distribution line installation, and 25.8 km of collection lines. It also included construction of six water tankers that have the capacity of holding from 1,000 cubic meters of water to 5,000 cubic meters of water. The Akaki well field is located to the southeast of Akaki town about 22 km south of the center of Addis Ababa within the Akaki catchment.   CGC Overseas Construction Co.

The borrowing terms of the loan (PBC) were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 23 year maturity. The Government of Ethiopia provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $475 million commercial contract [ID# ET/ERC/CREC/0901] between the ERC and China Railway Group Limited (CREC), which was signed on September 3, 2009. The ERC was responsible for directly funding the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($71,250,000). Its direct contribution was payable in ETB as a down payment (with exchange rate applicable to the base date.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 42% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 3,097,176.899) between 2014 and 2016: an ETB 327,586,207 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 905,511,811 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 680,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 989,898,990 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 544,700 disbursement on October 7, 2015, and an ETB 193,635,191 disbursement on April 7, 2016.   The Addis Ababa light rail metro system is a 31.6 km electrified light rail transportation system with two lines: a 17.4 kilometer east-west line and a 16.9 kilometer north-south line. The east-west line stretches from Ayat village to Tor Hailoch passing through Megenagna, Legehar and Mexico Square The north-south line passes through Menelik II Square, Merkato, Lideta, Leghar, Meskel Square, Gotera and Kaliti. The light rail metro system was designed to facilitate transportation in a city of 5 million clogged with other forms of transportation.  Each train was planned have a capacity to carry 286 passengers for a maximum capacity of 300,000 passengers/day. CREC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The EPC contract identifies January 31, 2012 as the expected project commencement date and January 30, 2015 as the expected project completion date. It also identifies a defects liability period of one year. The project site was ultimately handed over to the EPC contractor on January 31, 2012. However, construction did not begin until April 2013. Trial operation of the railway began on February 1, 2015. The north-south line commenced operations on September 20, 2015, and the east-west line commenced operations on November 9, 2015.    According to official figures, the rail system carried on average 105,000-110,000 daily passengers during its first 14 months of operations. Tickets initially cost two to six birr ($0.08 to $0.20), depending on the distance of the trip. ERC earned $5 million in revenue from the light rail line during the Ethiopian Fiscal Year 2016/17, and by January 2017, the rail system had carried over 50 million customers. The rail system was initially supposed to be run by the Shenzhen Metro Group and CRECG until 2020. However, in 2018, the ERC was prepared to take over the operation of the railway from CRECG.   Since then, the railway has faced an array of operational performance and revenue generation problems. The Addis Ababa light rail metro system initially began operating with 40 trains, but as of 2021, it was regularly operating with approximately 20 trains. Addis Ababa’s deputy mayor has also noted that the city’s electrical grid lacked the capacity to power the system before construction began. Even with its own dedicated power supply, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system still experiences power outages and delays, leading to packed cars and poor service. Additionally, in 2021, Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General found that, during its first four years in operation, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system generated $11.1 million of revenue but cost $154 million to operate. It found that the system was falling far short of its original feasibility study, which said it would pay for its construction costs within 10 years through ticket sales, advertising and renting out spaces in stations, among other methods: '[t]he feasibility study has been inadequate, and it was conducted without collecting enough information. […] This, coupled with the absence of a maintenance center to fix the trains that need repair and other factors, have contributed to the losses sustained by the light railway.'

The loan was then approved by Gabon's President and Council of Ministers on February 21, 2013. The GCL carries a 20 year maturity and a 2.5% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a 2009 commercial contract between Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd and Gabon’s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and the Ministry of Economy and Trade.   The project involved the construction of a substation in Angondje, the expansion of two substations in Ambowe and Bissegué, and the construction three overhead transmission lines and two underground cable transmission lines measuring 130 km in length.   Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd was the contractor responsible for implementation. Its ultimate objective was to better connect Libreville to surrounding areas. Its work was overseen by the Electricity Office of Energy and Hydraulic Resources Department of the Government of Gabon. The project officially commenced on June 10, 2011. As of May 2014, the new substation in Angondje, the expansion of the two substations in Ambowe (Ntoum) and Bissegué, and the construction of a 23 km underground cable transmission line from Ambowe to Owendo (connecting to the Ambowe-Owendo power plant) were completed. Although this project was completed, it precise completion date is unknown.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Libreville Electricity Network Renovation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).

Then, on December 16, 2011, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a $3 billion master facility agreement. This agreement established two lending facilities: Tranche A and Tranche B.  Tranche A is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 15 year maturity, 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, a 0.25% upfront fee, and a 1% commitment fee. Tranche B is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 10 year maturity, 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee. The borrower is responsible for repaying CDB every six months at the end of each interest period. This project captures Tranche A. Tranche B is captured in #85282.   Also, under the terms of the master facility agreement, the borrower is required to maintain a balance of 1.5 times the repayment amount (for each six month cycle) in a designated “Debt Service Reserve Account” at all times. Additionally, to facilitate repayment of the loan principal and interest, the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co. (UNIPEC Asia) signed an offtaker for the sale and purchase of crude oil. Under the terms of this agreement, GNPC agreed to supply and sell 13,000 barrels of crude oil from Jubilee Field each day to UNIPEC Asia over a 15.5 year period. The proceeds from these oil sales were then deposited into a special account to facilitate loan repayment and provide a source of collateral. The parties agreed that the term of the offtaker agreement should extend beyond the repayment period of the loan to allow CDB to be fully repaid if necessary.   The projects that were initially identified as eligible for funding through Tranche A included the Western Corridor Renewal Project, the Western Corridor Infrastructure Renewal Project, the Sekondi Free Zone Project, Accra Plains Irrigation Project Phase 1, Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project, Eastern Corridor Multi-Modal Transportation Project. Projects that were initially identified as eligible for funding through Tranche B included Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Project, Takoradi Petroleum Terminal Project, Western Corridor 'Oil Enclave' Toll Road Redevelopment Project, ICT Enhanced Surveillance Project (also known as Integrated National Security Communications Enhancement Project), the Accra Intelligent Traffic Management Project, and the SME Projects Incubation Facility.   Under the terms of the master facility agreement, subsidiary loan agreements must be negotiated to secure financial support for any given project. On June 13, 2012, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed the first subsidiary loan agreement worth $850 million — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Development Project (WCGIDP) (captured in #58586). In April 2013, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed the second subsidiary loan agreement worth $150 million — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the ICT Enhanced Surveillance Project.   Then, in mid-2014, the Government of Ghana sought to cap the value of the master facility agreement at $1.5 billion. However, the parties reportedly came to an impasse when CDB requested an additional 2,000 barrels of oil per day beyond the original 13,000 barrels specified in the original off-taker agreement. According to Ghana’s Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the master facility agreement was “unfrozen” and reactivated in 2017. Then, in 2018, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed the third subsidiary loan agreement worth $185,570,000 — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project. This project was originally identified as eligible for lending through the Tranche A facility; however, the Government of Ghana and CDB agreed to fund it through the Tranche B facility and shorten the maturity of the loan to ensure that the off-taker agreement did not extend beyond its current term. As such, the terms of lending for this project (9 year maturity, 3 year grace period, 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee) were slightly different than the terms specified for lending through the Tranche B facility in the master facility agreement signed on December 16, 2011.   In 2018, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana also signed the fourth subsidiary loan agreement worth $210,660,000 — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the Accra Intelligent Traffic Management Project.   #58586 captures the $850 million subsidiary loan agreement for the Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Development Project (WCGIDP).  #60039 captures the $150 million subsidiary loan agreement for the ICT Enhanced Surveillance Project (also known as Integrated National Security Communications Enhancement Project. #30578 captures the $185,570,000 subsidiary loan agreement for the Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project. #73140 captures the $210,660,000 million subsidiary loan agreement for the Accra Intelligent Traffic Management Project.

(2011) 6 TOTAL NO. (157)] for Phase 2 of the E-Government Platform Project. The agreement was approved by Ghana’s Parliament on March 23, 2011. The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity and a 5 year grace period.  The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was GHS 585,180,000 ($104,496,428) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 560,900,000 ($107,865,384) as of December 31, 2021.  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the loan (PBC) achieved a 100% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 12 loan disbursements (worth $127,500,018) between 2012 and 2016: a $21,437,752.35 disbursement on October 30, 2012, a $9,240,586.43 disbursement on November 30, 2012, a $7,625,619.56 disbursement on January 4, 2013, a $3,936,102.17 disbursement on May 30, 2013, a $3,920,928.08 disbursement on July 5, 2013, a $10,309,849.00 disbursement on May 6, 2014, a $21,451,082.45 disbursement on June 30, 2014, a $15,064,678.64 disbursement on November 15, 2014, a $15,798,656.93 disbursement on December 15, 2014, a $10,229,242.82 disbursement on April 17, 2015, a $4,806,379.41 disbursement on January 5, 2016, and a $3,679,140.16 disbursement on June 6, 2016.   The project involved the extension of the Ghana National fiber optic backbone network by an additional 31 km; the deployment of 29 Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) Base Transceiver Stations in the cities of Ho, Tema Accra, Cape Coast, Takoradi, Koforidua, Nkawkaw, Obuasi, Kumasi, Sunyani, Tarkwa, Tamale, Bolgatanga and Wa; the deployment of a primary data center in Accra; the provision of Voice over IP to approximately 100 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs); the provision of video conferencing facilities to two sites; and an extension to reach all 170 districts via leased links from any of the local ISPs or fixed and mobile operator. The project also involved the construction of 21 electronic Community Information Centers (e-CICs) in geographic areas lacking internet facilities — namely, Keta, Battor, Techiman-Krobo, Twifo Atti-Morkwa, Bodi, Effiduase, Glefe, Pantang, Amanfrom, Drobonso, Anum, Bekwai, Nandom, Welembelle, Sagnarigu, Pusiga, Gambaga, Kpetoe, Talensi, Ofoase, and Lassia-Tuolu. The ultimate purpose of the e-CICs is to expand civic engagement and access to technology in rural and remote Ghanaian localities.  Huawei Technologies (GH) S.A. Ltd. — a local subsidiary of Huawei Technologies Ltd. -- was the contractor responsible for implementation.  The originally expected project implementation start and end dates were February 16, 2011 and December 31, 2015, respectively. However, the project was ultimately completed on June 6, 2016.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Phase 2 of E-Government Platform Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears).

1290,"China Eximbank provides RMB 716.9 million government concessional loan for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#34174) The Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral & Research Hospital project was conceptualized in 2008. The Government of Kenya, through various line ministries, supported the idea developed by Kenyatta University Management led by the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Olive Mugenda. The idea came to fruition with the signing of an MoU on April 21, 2011, between the Chinese and Kenyan governments.   Then, on June 17, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya’s National Treasury signed an RMB 744,560,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 716,983,703.70. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20.75 year maturity, and a 7.25 year grace period. The loan was scheduled for semi-annual repayment installments beginning on September 21, 2018, and ending on March 21, 2032.    The National Treasury on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral & Research Hospital (KUTRRH), which is a Kenyan state corporation. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the ultimate borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Kenya and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Co-operation (CJIC), which was signed on August 12, 2010.  The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 27,576,296 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 55,152,592.00 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).  The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 661,831,110.11 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 606,678,517.52 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 551,525,924.93 as of June 30, 2022.  The project involved the construction of Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital (肯雅塔大学教学转诊医院) in Nairobi. The hospital covers an area of more than 600 acres with a total construction area over 80,000 square meters, has a total of more than 650 beds, 8 high-grade operating rooms, 1 maternal center, 1 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 1 intensive care unit (ICU), 1 special intensive care unit (HDU), as well as medical imaging center, central supply room, oxygen, and medical gas system, boiler and laundry, medical waste treatment, funeral facilities, restaurant, teaching center, dormitory, and other supporting facilities. Construction of the 650-bed hospital involved the expansion and equipping of anatomy and basic science laboratories and the establishment of pre-clinical and clinical teaching departments at the university.    CJIC was the contractor responsible for implementation.  The project was originally scheduled to enter implementation in 2012 and reach completion by June 30, 2019. Construction commenced on November 1, 2012 and ended on December 14, 2016.   A formal project handover ceremony took place on May 24, 2019. However, the hospital did not open its doors to the first patient until October 28, 2019 after successfully conducting a ‘dry run’ from September 27, 2019 to October 27, 2019, followed by a successful 'soft run' from October 28, 2019 to November 24, 2019. To operationalize the first 160 beds, the hospital operationalized the oncology, renal dialysis, accident and emergency, trauma and orthopaedics, ICU, radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, mortuary, and other allied services. The hospital was designated as an isolation and treatment center on March 24, 2020 with over 400 beds designated for COVID-19 patients. A formal hospital opening ceremony took place on September 10, 2020. Then, in October 2021, an advanced cancer imaging center (known as the Integrated Molecular Imaging Centre Hospitality and Accommodation Centre) was launched at the hospital.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender and Kenya's National Treasury. As of October 17, 2018, 85% of the China Eximbank loan (worth 8,756,025,600 Kenyan shillings) had been disbursed and utilized. However, the remaining 15% of the loan (worth approximately 1.37 billion Kenyan shillings) had not yet disbursed in support of the personnel and capacity building component of the loan because disbursement was conditional upon the training of personnel (who were yet to be recruited by Kenyatta University due to ‘budgetary constraints’). KUTRRH was ultimately unable to meet its loan repayment obligations (due to the fact that it was generating insufficient revenue) and the National Treasury had to step in to ensure repayments to China Eximbank. Then, in December 2021, it was revealed by the Kenyan Government that KUTRRH was converted into an independent parastatal entity (and severed from Kenyatta University) on January 25, 2019 in order to use its future revenues to recover the funds needed to repay the China Eximbank loan.  1.

26313,"China Eximbank provides $176.5 million preferential buyer's credit for Southern Bypass Project On December 1, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a $183.6 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No. (2011) 32 Total No. (183) No. (1420303052011211528)] for the Southern Bypass Road Project. The face value of the PBC was subsequently revised to $176,538,461.54. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 6-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The loan is scheduled for semi-annual repayments in equal installments from January 21, 2018, to January 21, 2032. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $216 million commercial (EPC) contract between Kenya National Highways Authority and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on November 17, 2010.   The borrower made principal repayments worth $7,061,538.46 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $14,123,076.92 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was $169,476,923.08 as of June 30, 2020, $155,353,846.15 as of June 30, 2021, and $141,230,769.23 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the Southern Bypass Project was to ease traffic congestion in Nairobi and divert traffic from the city center. The 28.6 km road starts at the junction of the Nairobi–Mombasa Road and Likoni Road, approximately 10 kilometers (6 mi) south-east of the city center. The road then loops through the south-western suburbs of Nairobi, including the northern environs of Nairobi National Park, Uhuru Gardens, Lang'ata, and Dagoretti. In Dagoretti, the road enters Kiambu County and then turns northwards, to pass through Muguga and end in the town of Kikuyu, in a suburb known as Gitaru. At that location, the road connects with the Nairobi-Malaba Road (A104).   Under the supervision of the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation of the project. The EPC contract went into effect on July 2, 2012. By June 2015, the project had achieved a 81.3% completion rate. However, at that time, CRBC was not in possession of the site for the National Park section due to a lengthy court case by Friends of the Nairobi National Park, which obtained an injunction that stopped KeNHA from constructing the road through the National Park. A court eventually ruled that KeNHA should follow due process and have the section of the National Park that was to be used for road construction appropriately gazetted. Upon gazettement, there were prolonged negotiations around the acquisition of a section of the National Park to facilitate the construction of the project. Negotiations between KeNHA and Kenya Wildlife Service for a grant of easement were subsequently completed and an agreement was signed on September 23, 2015. CRBC was granted possession of the site for the project's National Park section on November 2, 2015. Construction activities were substantially complete as of June 22, 2016 (with a defect liability of 12 months). The project was officially completed on November 1, 2016.  The originally scheduled project completion date (per the EPC contract) was July 31, 2015.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Southern Bypass Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Kenya had delayed payments worth more than 3.6 billion Kenyan shillings that were owed to CRBC and landowners displaced by the project, exposing the Government of Kenya to financial penalties and additional interest payments. Kenya’s Auditor General Nancy Gathungu said that the Treasury had fallen behind in remitting 1.2 billion Kenyan shillings to CRBC for the Southern Bypass Project. Gathungu also said that the Treasury had delayed 2.4 billion Kenyan shillings in compensation to landowners displaced by the project corridor. Gathungu warned that taxpayers would be saddled with more financial penalties and additional interest payments if the Kenyan Government did not regularize its payments: '[a]lthough the management has committed to liaise with the line ministry and the National Treasury for adequate budgetary allocation and timely exchequer releases for prompt payments in the subsequent financial year, the project is at risk of incurring additional costs by way of interests and penalties with the continued delay in making the payments.' 1.

The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 296,153,846.15. The loan was provided with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, and 20 year maturity. It was scheduled for repayment in semi-annual installments from March 21, 2018 to March 21, 2031. The loan was finalized after Chinese Communist Party official Wan Qishan signed an agreement on March 18, 2011, with a Kenyan government counterpart on an enterprise messaging and collaboration system (EMACS) that would aim to set up an e-government platform -- called the Government Shared Service Application (GSSA) -- to improve inter-office collaboration and thereby reduce government operation costs.

The purpose of this project was to install an Enterprise Messaging and Collaboration System (EMACS) — also known as a Unified Messaging System — encompassing email, SMS, fax, voicemail and video messaging to allow citizens to contact government offices through email and ask questions, seek clarifications and also give comments if necessary. Once implemented, it was envisaged that communication among central Government staff, Ministries, Departments and agencies would be issued with a uniform domain name for their emailing system (gov.ke). Before the project was implemented, many Kenyan government employees were using their personal email addresses to perform government business.  Other than the email system which targeted 50,000 users, the Unified Messaging System (EMACS) sought to address human resource issues including management of personnel information as well as training.   ZTE Corporation was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project entered implementation on October 1, 2011, and it was originally scheduled for completion on December 31, 2013.

46982," China Eximbank provides RMB 188.3 million government concessional loan for Phase 1 of Technical And Vocational Training Laboratories (TIVET) Project (Linked to Project ID#59494) In 2009, Kenya’s Ministry of Education decided to invest in revamping technical and vocational education and sought help from the Chinese Government. The Chinese Embassy in Nairobi recommended AVIC International as an industry partner. Then, on March 18, 2011, China Eximbank signed an RMB 196 million government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement with the Government of Kenya for Phase 1 of the Kenya-China Technical And Vocational Training Laboratories (TIVET) Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 188,359,677.88. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period. The loan was scheduled for repayment in semiannual installments between March, 21, 2018 and March 21, 2031. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a $30 million (KES 3.3 billion) commercial contract between AVIC International (中航国际) and the Government of Kenya's Ministry of Education (肯尼亚高教部), which was signed in January 2010.   The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 7,534,387.10 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 15,068,774.20 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 165,756,516.10 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 150,687,741.87 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 135,618,967.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the project was to establish 10 vocational and technical institutes — including Coast Institute of Technology, Kabete National Polytechnic, Kenya Coast National Polytechnic, Nyeri National Polytechnic, and the Technical University of Kenya — and provide training to 15,000 students. Training subjects were to cover electrical/electronic engineering, mechanical engineering and rapid prototyping manufacturing. The project also involved the provision of teaching materials and equipment (including diesel generators).   AVIC International was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The originally scheduled implementation start date of the project was July 2, 2012, and the originally scheduled project completion date was June 30, 2017. Project implementation actually commenced in January 2013 and ended in April 2017. The official project handover date was on or around July 19, 2017. As of March 2016, AVIC International had sent 54 teachers and trained 15,000 local students. An ex-post review of the project by Kenya's Auditor General revealed that 1 university and 9 technical training institutes were supplied with electrical/electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, rapid prototyping manufacturing laboratories, and diesel generators (at a cost of $29,281,624 or approximately KES 2,490,159,083), but a physical verification of the equipment in all ten of the vocational and technical institutes revealed that the equipment had not been utilized to full capacity and the generators had not been put to use.  The Auditor General identified a lack of power supply to operationalize the equipment as a key constraint on its use. To address the problem of equipment disuse, AVIC International also launched a skills development initiative called the Africa Tech Challenge. According to Mr. Shikoli Isalambo Benard of the Kenyan Ministry of Education, he told an AVIC International project manager that ‘you’ve given us huge equipment, but the equipment is just here. We’re not utilizing it. So if we have a competition to support this equipment, then really, you’ll be helping us as a country to build the confidence of our students, that they can make things which can actually go out there.’ 1. This project is also known as the Kenya-China Project on Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Equipment in Universities and Technical Training Institutes or Phase 1 of the Kenya-China Technical And Vocational Training Laboratories (TIVET) Project.

Then, on December 12, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Lesotho signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 200 million to support Phase 2 of the National Telecom Network Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown.   The Government of Lesotho used the proceeds of the loan to on-lend to Econet Telecom Lesotho, a state-owned telecommunications operator in Lesotho. Econet Telecom Lesotho (ETL), in turn, used the loan proceeds to expand, upgrade and modernize Lesotho’s telecommunications infrastructure. Anhui Telecom Engineering Co. was the contractor responsible for Phase 2. Work appears to have began shortly after Anhui Telecom Engineering Co. signed an implementation agreement on April 24, 2012. The project was officially handed over to the Government of Lesotho on May 31, 2013.   ETL did not honor its repayment obligations to the Government of Lesotho under the terms of its on-lending agreement. According to a Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Government of Lesotho for the Three Years 2013/14, 2014/15, and 2015/16 And Other Incidental Findings published by the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament of Lesotho, '[Econet Telecom Lesotho] claims that it is not making profits but this is hard to believe as the Committee suspects transfer pricing practices. Again, the services have not improved as expected when the loan was secured for Econet. The Committee [is] concerned the Government of Lesotho is shouldering the burden of paying the loans on behalf of Econet while Econet is not remitting anything to the Government [of Lesotho].' 1.

The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date:  March 21, 2031), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: September 21, 2016), and a 2% interest rate.   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 341,396,673.36 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 35,936,491 until 2031.  The project involved the construction of the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) in the district of Thyolo. The university was designed to accommodate 3,000 students.   The contractor responsible for project implementation was Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group Co., Ltd. (AFECC). Project implementation began on April 9, 2011. The project was scheduled for completion in time for the 2013/14 academic year and the official project handover ceremony took place on December 13, 2013.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2021, Malawi's Minister of Finance announced that ‘in 2020/21 FY, Government [of Malawi] requested temporary debt service suspension from bilateral creditors. This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In July 2023 correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Government of Malawi revealed that it was in negotiations with China Eximbank about rescheduling all of their loans with amounts outstanding. The Government of Malawi proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 50 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 90 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 89 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 88 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 87 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 86 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 85 million in principal and interest payments in 2032.

SOMINA is the registered holder of the mining license for the Azelik Uranium Mine granted by the Government of Niger on November 8, 2007 for a period of 20 years covering a mining area of 220 square kilometers. On June 23, 2009, China Eximbank and SOMINA signed a $142,000,000 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#91977). Under the terms of the BCL agreement, Somina was required to repay the loan in 11 installments, and pay interest on a quarterly basis. The loan was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It was also collateralized against equipment and vehicles owned by SOMINA and CNNC International Limited’s 37.2% equity stake in Somina. The outstanding principal of the GCL was approximately $90,880,000 on October 30, 2014, $78,100,000 on June 30, 2015, on $78,100,000 on August 19, 2015. Approximately three months earlier, on March 17, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Niger signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project. Then, in April 2011, China Eximbank and Société du Patrimoine des Mines du Niger (SOPAMIN) -- a Nigerian public holding company that manages the Government of Niger’s holdings in mining companies operating in the country — signed an RMB 650 million ($103 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#256). The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.   The proceeds of the loan were on-lent to SOMINA and used to finance the Government of Niger's 33% ownership stake in SOMINA.  The loan proceeds were also used by SOMINA to partially finance a $139.92 million commercial contract between Sinohydro Corporation Limited and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNCC), which was signed on March 31, 2008. Then, on August 24, 2009, SOMINA, as seller, and China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation (中國原子能工業有限公司) (CNEIC),  as purchaser, entered into a Long-term Sales Contract. Under the terms of the Long-term Sales Contract, SOMINA agreed to sell and CNEIC agreed to purchase all uranium ore concentrates produced by SOMINA for a term ending on December 31, 2022. The purpose of the Azelik Uranium Mine Project was to develop the Teguidda mine at the Azelik uranium deposit. In addition to the development of the uranium mine, this project supported the construction of two coal-fired power plants and a hydrometallurgy plant.    China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation was responsible for the design of the project, and Sinohydro Corporation Limited was responsible for the implementation of the project. Trial operations of the mine began on December 10, 2010, with the first barrel of yellow cake uranium being produced on December 30, 2010. The mine officially started operations on March 17, 2011 and it reached a maximum capacity of 700 tons per year in 2012. However, mine production was suspended in mid-February 2015 due to cash flow problems. SOMINA reported at the time that its cash flow problems were the result of multiple factors, include the low and declining international price of uranium, delays in certain construction works related to the uranium mine, delays in the granting of a ‘favorable’ loan to SOMINA by the Government of Niger due to a military coup in Niger in 2010, and certain production process difficulties. In August 2015, SONIMA informed its shareholders that it extended a settlement with the local workforce for a temporary redundancy arrangement in compliance with the Niger labour law, until the end of August 2015. At that time, the mine was under temporary suspension and its production was expected to resume as soon as SOMINA’s cash flow position improved. However, as of 2021, mine production had still not resumed. SOMINA also faced criticism and pressure related to local protests over the lack of employment of local ethnic groups. low wages, and environmental degradation. This project also encountered a series of debt repayment problems.   On January 11, 2014, Focus International Development Corporation (FIDC) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNNC International Limited — and SOMINA signed a $4,500,000 bridge loan agreement with a 1-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 5.8% (captured via Project ID#91979).  As of the bridge loan’s final maturity date (December 31, 2014), the loan’s outstanding principal and interest were $4,343,257.88 and $182,856.78, respectively. Then, on January 2, 2015, FIDC and SOMINA signed a second bridge loan agreement worth $9,135,096.40 with a 2-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 7.8% (or the Hong Kong Dollar Best Lending Rate plus a 0.8% margin). The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#91980) were to be used to refinance the accounts payable by SOMINA to CNNC (including the outstanding amount under the January 11, 2014 loan from FIDC), such that CNNC was not required to advance any new monies to SOMINA.

According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $349,999,999.99 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $282,692,309.99. The 51 km expressway project was expected to cost $476 million, with $126 million of the funding coming from the Government of Uganda.   China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project. The project was supervised by Beijing Expressway Supervision Company. The purpose of the project was to construct a toll road from Entebbe Airport to the country’s capital, Kampala. It was part of Government of Uganda’s overall strategy for decongesting Kampala through construction of an inner beltway comprising the Kampala Northern and Southern Bypasses as well as an outer beltway along the edges of the Great Kampala Metropolitan Area. It also aimed to enhance trade and movement between the two cities. The four-lane highway also features at least four toll stations and four interchanges with overpasses, along with a connection to the new highway to Munyonyo, Uganda’s major international conference destination. The link between the new highway and Munyonyo includes a 3 km, two-lane bridge constructed to run over a Nile River marshland that cuts across the proposed road link.   Construction was originally expected to begin around July 2012, with the project taking three years to complete (July 2015). On November 21, 2012, President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday officially launched the project at a groundbreaking ceremony in Kyengera. The project was ultimately completed on June 15, 2018. However, it has reportedly underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives. Seventeen months after the completion of the project, the tolling system for the expressway was still not operational. Traffic levels were low, which cast doubt on whether the Government of Uganda would generate enough toll revenue to meet its principal and interest repayment obligations under the China Eximbank PBC loan.   Also, as of April 2019, the Government of Uganda had still not passed a law to allow for tolling on the road. But its first loan repayment to China Eximbank was due on May 22, 2019. As of 2021, a company had just been contracted to manage the toll collection process, the expressway remained underutilized, and tolls were still not being collected. While some trips from Kampala to Entebbe have seen significant reductions in travel time, the 51 km expressway has reportedly failed to alleviate the main traffic bottlenecks that affect most trips from the city center. The new expressway does not reach downtown – it only connects to the Northern Bypass which is also difficult to reach from downtown during the peak traffic period. It does, however, provide a good connection between the international airport, the President’s Palace in Entebbe, and the Munyonyo Resort on the lake where President Museveni entertains foreign dignitaries. According to ITDP Africa, which did an analysis of the traffic problem on the old Entebbe-Kampala highway, the traffic bottleneck was almost entirely caused by a few saturated roundabouts and double-parked vehicles at a critical market. ITDP Africa concluded that ‘it was clearly not necessary to spend $475 million’ on the construction of a new expressway. 1. The Chinese project title is 的坎帕拉-恩德培机场高速路及机场扩建项目. 2.

The loan was signed in the presence of the Finance Minister of Zimbabwe, Tendai Biti, the President of the Export-Import Bank of China, Li Riougu, the Zimbabwean Vice President, Joice Mujuru, and the Vice Premier of China, Wang Qishan. It was also ratified by Zimbabwe’s Parliament.

The purpose of this project was to facilitate for the acquisition of tractors and other agricultural machinery.  As of May 2020, this loan had not yet been disbursed due to the fact that the Government of Zimbabwe did not meet a key condition of the loan agreement: the provision of a 10% down payment.  As such, this loan appears to be inactive or in state of suspension.  Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development did not identify this loan as an outstanding obligation in its 2019 Blue Book Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure.

Zimbabwean Vice President Joyce Mujuru signed the loan agreement in Harare. The loan agreement followed the signing of a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by the Chinese Government and Government of Zimbabwe for the financing of various development projects. Officials from Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance, representatives from China Eximbank and Sinosure signed the MOU. Sinosure agreed to provide insurance cover for various loans issued by China Eximbank. The BCL that was issued on March 21, 2011 carried the following borrowing terms: an 11 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.375% management fee, and a 0.375% commitment fee.    However, its face value was subsequently revised to $140,825,714.38. The purpose of this project was to support the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. More specifically, the proceeds of the loan were to be used to rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant, the Prince Edward Water Treatment plant, the Crowborough sewage plant, the Firle sewage plant, and pump stations at Warren Control, Alex Park, and Letombo. Some of the loan proceeds were also earmarked for information technology and automated billing activities, the acquisition of water treatment chemicals, the installation of laboratory, the installation of pressure-reducing valves, and the installation of prepaid meters in 500,000 households.  China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project.     This project officially entered into force on January 26, 2013, but it was plagued by various delays and controversies. In 2013, China Eximbank reportedly withheld loan disbursements due to the Government of Zimbabwe’s failure to meet its outstanding obligation under a 1997 loan that it provided to Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries (See Project ID#17125). In September 2013, 19 Chinese engineers joined a larger 46 engineer team to work on the project. Then, in June 2014, the deadline for project completion was pushed forward from April 2016 to June 2015. As of June 2014, several areas previously not receiving water had access and obsolete equipment was removed from facilities, the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant was operating at 70 percent capacity, and two pressure-reducing valves were installed at Warren Park D and Ardbennie.   A month later, in July 2014, an investigation was launched after the Harare City Council was accused of spending $8 million of the loan proceeds to purchase 25 luxury vehicles. Harare City Council insisted that the vehicles were for service deliveries; however, China Eximbank decided to withhold loan disbursements after learning that the loan proceeds were not being used for the intended purposes. As of June 2017, only half of the China Eximbank loan (approximately $72 million) had been disbursed. As of February 2020, China Eximbank was still withholding loan disbursements for this project. There is also evidence that the Government of Zimbabwe has fallen behind on its loan repayment schedule. As of 2018, the borrower had accumulated principal and interest arrears and penalties worth $28,430,361.10.   Also, according to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was still in arrears at the end of 2021. Total external debt arrears to China Eximbank at the end of 2021 included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project. The loan’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $80,640,308.76 as of September 2021. 1. This project was financed as part of a larger $566 million umbrella agreement, which is captured via Project #63444. 2. At the time that the 2011 loan agreement for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project was presented to Zimbabwe’s Parliament for ratification, the maturity length of the loan was identified as 9 years, which implies that 2020 was final maturity date under the original loan agreement. However, in the 2019 Blue Book Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure published by Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the final maturity date of the loan is identified as 2022, which implies an 11 year maturity. The IMF also reports that this loan has an 11 year maturity. 3. This project is also known as the Harare City Water Reticulation Project and the City of Harare Project.

The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract [ID# 000478/MINEE/CAB] between the Government of Cameroon's Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), which was signed on March 16, 2009. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (GCL) had achieved a 98.4% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 16.1 billion.   The project involved the construction of a rockfill dam, a 105-million cubic meters reservoir, a 15 MW power plant (with three, 5MW power generators), a 6.3/110KV interconnection substation in Mekin, a 110/30KV interconnection substation at Ndjom Yekombo, and a 110/30kV high-voltage transmission line from Mekin to Ndjom Yekombo (connected to the southern power grid). The dam and power plant are located in arrondissement of Meyomessala and electricity is evacuated to the eight districts of the Dja and Lobo Division, South Region. China National Electric Equipment Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The Cameroonian Government also established a state-owned company -- called Hydro Mekin (or Hydromekin) -- to oversee implementation of the project. Project implementation commenced November 2011 and it was completed on December 23, 2015. However, after the facility was powered up in June 2019, it experienced technical difficulties. The facility was put back into production in May 2021 and it currently supplies the D31 Sangmélima and D32 Meyomessala feeders.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 15MW Mekin Hydropower Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed).

53292,"China Eximbank provides RMB 215 million government concessional loan for National Fiber Optic Backbone Transmission Network Project On December 2, 2010, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Comoros signed an RMB 215 million ($31,759,726.30) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the National Fiber Optic Backbone Transmission Network Project. The face value of the loan was roughly equivalent to 5.5 percent of the country’s total GDP. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 25-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 1% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.75% commitment fee. Then, on December 27, 2010, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was concluded between the Government of Comoros and Comores Télécom (the country’s state-owned telecommunications operator), which transferred the loan agreement with China Eximbank to Comores Télécom. The MOU stipulates that the Government of Comoros will serve as the ultimately guarantor of the payment of the loan and assume responsibility for repayment in the event of default by Comores Télécom. Also, under the terms of the MOU, Comores Télécom pledges to (a) use the proceeds of the loan borrowed for two specific sub-projects (the Inter-Island Fiber Optic Network Sub-Project and National Backbone Sub-Project) and the improvement and expansion of national telecommunications infrastructure; (b) repay the amounts borrowed, plus interest, within the contractual timeframes and pay any other expenses that may be necessary for the execution of the agreement; and (c) make direct payments to China Eximbank and transmit a copy of the payment order to the Government of Comoros’ National Debt Directorate [Direction nationale de la dette DND]. No provisions were made in the MOU for a debt guarantee fee or obligation to transmit to the DND any information essential for monitoring the loan. Also, neither the DND nor the sector commission of the National Committee for Public Debt Management (CNDP) participated in the negotiations that resulted in this loan agreement.   The purpose of this project was to increase connectivity between the islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mayotte in the Comoros Archipelago. The new 260-km cable project involved laying 2 fiber optic cables: one linking Mayotte to Mutsamudu on Anjouan Island (referred to as FLY-LION3), and another connecting Moroni to Chindini on Grand Comores (called the Avassa cable system). The landing party at Moroni, Chindini and Mutsamudu was Comores Télécom and STOI at Mayotte. Hengtong Marine Cable System Co. and Huawei Marine Networks Co. Ltd. were the contractors responsible for implementation. The first loan disbursement took place in 2015 and the project officially commenced on October 10, 2015. Then, on January 15, 2017, Huawei Marine Networks Co. Ltd. successfully delivered the new AVASSA submarine cable to Comores Télécom, which connected the Grande Comores and Anjouan Island with Mayotte. This effectively represented the completion date of the project. 1.

With respect to the $88 million loan for the Djiri Water Treatment Distribution Network Project, the (principal) amount outstanding was $39,256,706 as of December 31, 2019.    All three of these projects sought to strengthen the Brazzaville drinking water supply system from the Djiri River. The Djiri Water Treatment Plant Rehabilitation Project involved the construction of a new water treatment plant called “Djiri 2” — north of the capital city of Brazzaville — with a treated water production capacity by 5,250 m3 per hour [“l’extension de l’usine d’eau de Djiri d’une capacité de production d’eau traitée supplémentaire de cinq mille deux cents cinquante (5.250) m3 par heure”]. It also involved the construction of: a new raw water intake to serve both the Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 water treatment plants; two raw water flow distribution structures, a ductile iron pipe (540 ml DN 1200) for the delivery of the total raw water flow for the Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 water treatment plants from the raw water pumping station to the primary distributor; a ductile iron pipe DN 700 for transferring the flow for Djiri 1 from the primary distributor to the secondary distributor; a water treatment system; a treated water tank with a capacity of 4,000 m3 (two compartments of 2,000 m3 each); a treated water pumping station with a capacity of 5,250 m3 / h, power 1,180 kW (i.e. 1,475 kVA), a common reagent building for the two water plants of Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 (the existing reagents building of Djiri 1 being converted into a reagent storage building for Djiri 1 and Djiri 2); two lime water saturators; a chlorine building housing the calcium hypochlorite dosing equipment for the two water plants and an electro chlorination station; a transformer station for the treated water pumping station equipped with two 6300 kVA transformers (including one emergency); a transformer station for filter washing equipment and process equipment, equipped with two 1000 kVA transformers (including one emergency); an electrical substation and an electricity distribution system; a control and supervision system; a television surveillance system; approximately 500 meter of fiber optic cable; a sanitation network; outdoor facilities; on-site accommodations for the staff of the Control Mission and the Administration; and fifteen new housing units (110 m 2 to 170 m 2 ) for operating staff.    The Djiri Water Treatment Distribution Network Project involved efforts to strengthen the treated water distribution network (“le renforcement du réseau de distribution d’eau traitée.”) in the capital city of Brazzaville. More specifically, it involved the rehabilitation of a 10,000 m³ reservoir and a 4,000 m³ water tower; the construction of seven reservoirs (6,000 m 3 , 5,000 m³, 3,500 m³, 3,000 m³, 2,250 m³, 1,250 m³, 300 m³); the construction of four recovery stations (80,000 m3 / d, 3 + 1 pumps 500 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 2,000 kVA; 8,200 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 200 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 630 kVA; 6,800 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 110 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 400 kVA; 1,800 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 30 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 160 kVA); the installation of power supply for recovery stations (laying approximately 2.3 km of 20 kV underground lines); the laying 183,000 ml of pipes for the primary network, including 61,000 ml of ductile iron DN 1000 to DN 500 and 122,000 ml of PVC pipes DN 400 to DN 200; and the installation of a remote management system between the sites of the recovery stations and reservoirs and the supervision room of the Djiri water treatment plants (for the transmission of data on water levels, flow rates).    The Djiri Water Treatment Plant Extension Project involved the rehabilitation (modernization) of a water treatment plant called ‘Djiri 1’ — that was originally built in 1983 and is co-located with the Djiri 2 water treatment plant north of the capital city of Brazzaville — with treated water production capacity of 2,250 m3 per hour [“la réhabilitation de l’usine d’eau existante de Djiri d’une capacité de deux mille deux cents cinquante (2.250) m3 par heure”]. More specifically, it involved civil engineering rehabilitation works (settling tanks, filters, treated water tank, treated water pumping station, annex buildings); the replacement of all existing equipment; and the rehabilitation of the 16 existing accommodations for operating staff.    China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of all three projects. The Djiri Water Treatment Plant Rehabilitation Project formally commenced on July 18, 2010; however, its construction began on November 11, 2009.

One of the subsidiary loans issued as part of the ‘Sino-Congolese Programme’ was a $33,859,673.85 loan for the 15 km Butembo Crossing Modernization Project. The loan ultimately achieved a disbursement rate of 100%.   This project involved construction of a 15 km road (or “crossing”) between the town of Butembo and the town of Beni in North Kivu Province. It was implemented in two phases. The project was part of the modernization of major arteries in the various provinces of the DRC. The 15 km road provides a quick and direct connection between the town of Butembo, which is a large shopping center, and the town of Beni. The latter city is also a major relay center for the city of Kasindi on the border with Uganda. Sinohydro 14 was the contractor responsible for implementation. It was awarded a $22,859,673.85 contract for Phase 1 on an unknown date. It was awarded an $11 million contract (ID#ACGT/DG/013/2015) for Phase 2 on August 1, 2015. Phase 1 construction activities began on February 2, 2011. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion date on March 2, 2012. Phase 2 construction began on May 17, 2015. It was expected to reach completion on May 28, 2016. The project reached provisional acceptance on May 28, 2016, and was officially completed on June 5, 2017. 1.

The PBC carried the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 2 year grace period, and a 17 year maturity. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $517 million commercial contract with Dalian International Economic and Technical Cooperation Group. CMEC Comtrans International Co., Ltd. appears to have also been involved in implementation (most likely as a subcontractor). This project involved the construction of between 4700 and 4800 affordable housing units in Malabo, Bata, and Rebola.

1380,"China Eximbank provides $99.45 million preferential buyer's credit for 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project (Linked to Project ID#30241) On July 19, 2009, the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia and China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) signed a $1 billion infrastructure cooperation agreement, which proposed 7 projects to be financed by China Eximbank through its preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) window. One of the projects that was identified was the Adama Wind Farm Project. One day later, on July 20, 2009, Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) signed an MOU with the Hydrochina-CGCOC JV (a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) to pursue the Adama Wind Farm Project in the form of a financing agreement and an EPC contract. Then, on September 22, 2009, EEPCO signed an EPC preliminary agreement for the 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project with Hydrochina-CGCOC JV. Hydrochina Corporation subsequently undertook a project feasibility study and an environmental impact assessment with support from EEPCO’s wind study center. Then, on November 23, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed a $99,450,000 (ETB 1,646,523,179) preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2010 (31) TOTAL NO. (138) 1420303052010211538] for the 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project. On January 21, 2011, the Ethiopian Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office approved the loan agreement. At the end of the same month, the Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed an on-lending agreement with EEPCO. The loan officially went into effect on May 25, 2011. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $117,994,500 commercial (EPC) contract [No. 33.20/12/09] between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on November 28, 2009.  The Ethiopian Government directly funded the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost (approximately $18,544,500).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $99,450,000 (ETB 1,646,523,179) loan (PBC) achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 7 loan disbursements (worth ETB 1,603,194,607) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 298,469,388 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 682,737,266 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 266,957,500 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 74,386,618 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 101,657,404 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 178,986,403 disbursement on July 7, 2013,  and an ETB 27 disbursement on November 15, 2017. The purpose of the project was to install a 51MW wind farm — with a total of 34 towers each generating 1.5 MW — on a site located 95 km east of Addis Ababa, near the city of Adama in Oromia.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, consultancy services were provided by the Addis Ababa University Faculty of Technology, while a Chinese firm called Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (or ‘Goldwind’) provided the wind turbines for the project. The EPC contract went into effect on November 12, 2009. The project was originally scheduled to commence on November 12, 2009, and reach completion on December 31, 2010. However, construction did not begin until June 2011. Then, an installation and hoisting ceremony for the project's wind turbines was held on April 21, 2012. Construction ended in June 2012. Then, the wind farm began commercial operations in August 2012.  According to the CGCOC, the wind farm began full operations in September 2012. An inauguration ceremony for the first phase of the Adama Wind Project was held on December 1, 2012.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama I Wind Farm Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.  1.

One source (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-022-00214-8) suggests that this project was financed through an Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Financing (EPC+F) arrangement. Under most EPC+F contractual arrangements, a loan is extended to the EPC contractor but with a sovereign guarantee from the host government. However, this is difficult to reconcile with the fact that China Eximbank financed the 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project through a PBC, which is a type of loan that is usually only issued to foreign government borrowers. This issue warrants further investigation. 4.

The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 14.5 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 3.067% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $495 million commercial contract between EEPCo and Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project, which was signed in May 2010.  According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 21,904,463,534) took place between 2012 and 2019: an ETB 1,102,591,696 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 1,256,266,119 disbursement on April 8, 2012, and an ETB 241,864,376 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 519,482,004 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 149,053,030 disbursement on October 7, 2013, an ETB 1,120,000,000 disbursement on October 7, 2014, an ETB 323,232,323 disbursement on January 7, 2015, an ETB 450,503,881 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 200,679,002 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 286,223,972 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 164,701,197 disbursement on July 7,, 2016, an ETB 1,359,428,420 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 116,911,052 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB 1,045,494,392 disbursement on March 20, 2018, and an ETB 13,568,032,070 disbursement on September 9, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to supply and install electrical and mechanical equipment (turbines) for the construction of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam (also known as the Gibe III Dam). The Gilgel Gibe III Dam is 610 m-long (2,000 ft) and 243 m (797 ft) high roller-compacted concrete dam. It withholds a reservoir with a capacity of 14.7 km3 (3.5 cu mi) and a surface area of 210 km2 (81 sq mi), collecting with a catchment area of 34,150 km2 (13,190 sq mi). The reservoir's live (active or ‘useful’) storage is 11.75 km3 (2.82 cu mi) and dead storage 2.95 km3 (0.71 cu mi). The normal operating level of the reservoir is 892 m (2,927 ft) above sea level with a maximum of 893 m (2,930 ft) and minimum of 800 m (2,600 ft). The dam's spillway is 108 m (354 ft) long and floodgate-controlled with a maximum discharge capacity of 18,000 m3/s (640,000 cu ft/s). Water above 873 m (2,864 ft) above sea level can be discharged through its gates. Feeding the dam's power house are two penstocks that each branch into five separate tunnels for each individual turbine. The power house contains ten 187 MW generators supported by Francis turbines for a total installed capacity of 1,870 MW.   DEC was responsible for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the project. Salini Costruttori S.p.A.(SPA), an Italian contractor, completed the civil engineering construction of the project.   The electro-mechanical portion of the project involved the design; build; site testing and commission of 10 vertical type hydraulic turbines; 10 vertical axis synchronous generators; and other transformer-related tasks. The hydro mechanical portion included the installation of steel structures; gates; a draft tube; a diversion tunnel; a spillway and ecological discharge gates.   The construction of the Gibe III dam began in July 2006 along the Omo River but the project provoked a backlash from environmental activists. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank were originally supposed to fund the electro-mechanical costs for the project, but they eventually backed out due to the project's perceived negative environmental and social impacts. In August 2015, Ethiopia commissioned the first phase of electricity generation at the Gibe III plant from three turbines with an output of 561MW. Then, on December 17, 2016, the Gibe III dam was officially inaugurated. The plant has 10 turbines each with a capacity of 187MW equaling a total capacity of 1,870MW, increasing Ethiopia's total electricity output to 4,238 megawatts. This project also reportedly created more than 7,000 jobs.

59050,"Chinese Government provides RMB 360 million interest-free loan for Pushkin Square-Gotera Interchange Road Project (Linked to Project ID#100 and ID#91947) On December 27, 2016, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified an RMB 360 million (ETB 623,366,177) interest-free loan agreement with the Chinese Government for the Pushkin Square-Gotera Interchange Road Project (via Proclamation no. 986/2017). The ratification proclamation entered into force on January 12, 2017.   The interest-free loan was issued by the Agency for International Economic Cooperation within China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The loan proceeds were drawn from Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ECTAs) that the Chinese Government and the Ethiopian Government had previously signed on July 20, 2010, April 18, 2011, August 15, 2011, January 28, 2012, October 29, 2012, and May 24, 2013.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance an RMB 308,526,277.10 commercial contract between Addis Ababa City Roads Authority and China First Highway Engineering Co., Ltd. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 623,366,177 loan achieved a 132% disbursement rate, with MOFCOM making 4 loan disbursements (worth ETB 825,594,492) between 2020 and 2021: an ETB 194,164,377 disbursement on June 9, 2020, an ETB 565,829,909 disbursement on March 24, 2021, an ETB 12,455,390 disbursement on August 17, 2021, and an ETB 53,144,816 disbursement on October 13, 2021.  However, according to the AMP, MOFCOM ultimately decided to cancel RMB 310 million of the Government of Ethiopia’s loan repayment obligations (due to its debt sustainability problems). This act of debt forgiveness is captured via Project ID#91947.   The project will involve the construction of a 3.8 km road with a width of 30-45 meters that stretches from Pushkin Square to Gotera Interchange in Nifas Silk Laphto District. It has three segments: a 2.3 km road from Pushkin Square to the Gotera Interchange section stretches to 2.3 km and two feeder roads — Mauritius Street and Tanzania Street — that measure 1.5 km in length. The project also includes a two-lane 320 meter tunnel, bus rapid transit (BRT), and two interchanges. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the project will reduce traffic congestion in Addis Ababa and ensure the smooth flow of vehicles coming from Kirkos, Gotera, Gofa, Sar Bet, Mexico and Keria. The Gotera-Pushkin Square interchange is being built to accommodate three planned BRT lines that all intersect there: the B2 (under construction with AFD financing), the B3 (under construction with Korean ExIm financing), and the B6 (under construction with Korean ExIm financing), as well as decently integrated facilities for non-motorized travel.   China First Highway Engineering Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of CCCC, is the contractor responsible for project implementation. A consortium consisting of First Highway Consultant Co., Ltd and Xi'an Fangzhou Engineering Consulting Company Co. Ltd is responsible for project management. Best Consulting Engineers Private Limited Company is responsible for providing project consulting services.    A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on October 1, 2019. Liu Yu, Economic and Commercial Counsellor at the Embassy of China, Takele Uma, Mayor of Addis Ababa, Ahmed Shide, Ethiopia’s Minister of Finance, and Tan Jian, Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, attended the ceremony. Then, in May 2020, the Deputy Mayor of Addis Ababa conducted a project site visit and announced that the project was expected to reach completion within a year (May 2021). The project ultimately reached completion on August 15, 2022.  This project has faced local scrutiny and criticism due to the fact that it was reportedly the most expensive road project to ever be undertaken (in unit cost terms) in Ethiopia (at ETB 395 million per kilometer of road).   According to an October 2021 report, ‘Chinese engineers do not appear to have played a significant role in the conceptual design of the interchange. The BRT facilities that have been incorporated into the design have largely been designed by the consultants to the [French Development Agency, AFD], with input from ITDP Africa, and the main role of the Chinese firm building the road was to follow the designs made by other consultants. Th[is] trajectory indicates significant improvement on the part of Chinese-financed urban road projects over the course of the decade, with considerable progress still to be made, but this improvement appears to result primarily from the increasing sophistication of the Ethiopian government authorities rather than from any push from the Chinese ECAs or Chinese companies’. 1.  Since loan terms for the interest-free loan are unavailable, AidData has set maturity period to 20 years by default and grace period to 10 years by default per China's Foreign Assistance White Paper (http://www.cidca.gov.cn/2018-08/06/c_129925064_3.htm) which states that the maturity period of interest-free loans is 20 years, with a drawdown period of 5 years, grace period of 5 years, and repayment over 10 years.

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 4,053,424,658 loan achieved a 111% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,499,623,058) between 2014 and 2019: an ETB 234,280,303 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 158,812,261 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 194,174,757 disbursement on April 8, 2014, an ETB 1,200,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 404,040,404 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 265,556,593 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 102,387,246 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 405,453,493 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 153,171,320 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 244,603,535 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 145,293,164 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 27,576,322 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 522,418,088 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 45,062,662 disbursement on April 7, 2017, and an ETB 396,792,911 disbursement on March 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct the 254MW Genale-Dawa III multipurpose hydropower plant. The plant consists of a concrete faced rock fill dam and an underground powerhouse. Based on the estimated sedimentation level, the project will have a lifetime of more than 1,000 years. The dam site is located in a low seismic hazard area of class I. The dam is 110m high, 456m wide and 450m long. It is made with groutable and non-erodible rock and has a volume of 3.2 million cubic metres (mm3). At the full capacity, the dam can store up to 2,570mm3 of water. It has a catchment area of 10,445km2 and a fill volume of 890,000m3. The dam spillway is an open chute type with an ogee weir crest and three radial spillway gates. The underground powerhouse is installed with three vertical Francis turbine generators with a capacity of 84.7MW each. It is housed within an underground cavern measuring 60m-long, 20m-wide and 41m deep and also includes auxiliary equipment. A 12.4km long, 8.1m diameter headrace tunnel carries water from the dam through a 188m deep steel-lined vertical shaft to a three-pronged manifold. The manifold feeds the water to the turbine inlet valves of the three turbines housed in the powerhouse. A 820m long tailrace tunnel and a 480m long open channel returns the water back to the river. A transformer cavern is located downstream of the powerhouse and includes three step-up transformers. The electricity generated is transferred from the transformers to a 230kV/400kV switchyard located above ground through a 500m long cable tunnel.   The project area is located in Kobadi, some 400 km (air distance) south-east of Addis Ababa and some 200 km (air distance) north of the border with Kenya. The scheme, including the reservoir and power waterways, extends over a river corridor some 55 km long. The approximate centroid of the project area lies at latitude 5º 38' North and longitude 39º 43' East.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, several other contractors were involved in the project. Stantec, a US-based company, provided design, planning, management and consulting services. Lahmeyer International, a German company, conducted the feasibility study. Tunnelpro, an Italy-based supplier, provided tunnel boring machines.   Project implementation commenced in March 2011 and the project was originally expected to commence on January 1, 2010 and reach completion within 48.5 months (January 15, 2014). However, the project encountered multiple implementation delays. An inauguration ceremony was held to commemorate the project’s completion on February 4, 2020. The project temporarily employed 390 Ethiopian workers.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 254MW Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.  1. This project is also known as the 254MW Genale-Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project, the Geneale-Dawa-Multi Purpose Hydroelectric Project, and the GD-3 Project. The Chinese project title is 埃塞GD-3水电站工程. 2. A September 26, 2010 amendment to the EPC contract between Gezhouba Group Company Limited and Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation indicates that the borrower is responsible for 15% of the EPC contract (Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation), which implies that the lender (China Eximbank) may have been responsible for 85% of the EPC contract value ($383,399,300.85). However, for the time being, AidData relies on the face value of the loan ($295,927,736) that is reported by the Ethiopia Public Sector Debt Statistical Bulletin No.7.  3. The system identification number for this project in the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP) is 87143122101156. 4. 1 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) was equal to 0.060 United States Dollars (USD) in September 2010 which implies that the loan commitment value recorded in the AMP (ETB 4,053,424,658) was equivalent to USD 243,205,479.48. SAIS-CARI identifies the face value of the loan as $270 million, which is roughly equivalent to 60% of the cost of the 2010 commercial (EPC) contract between EEPCo and CGGC. 5. Ethiopia Public Sector Debt Statistical Bulletin No.7. identifies the loan commitment date as October 27, 2010. The AMP identifies the loan commitment date as September 1, 2010. This discrepancy warrants further investigation. 6.  In 2009, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank signed a $400 million general buyer’s credit loan agreement for multiple road and power projects, including the 254MW Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project.

The Government of Gabon holds a 28.9% ownership stake in Comilog. The loan carries a 11.5 year maturity period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 4.3% margin (0.478% + 4.3% = 4.778%). ICBC provided 70% of the financing ($109.9 million) while BNP Paribas provide the remaining 30% ($47.1 million). BNP Paribas acted as the mandated lead arranger, facility agent and security agent.   The first loan disbursement was scheduled for April 2011, and loan repayments were scheduled over 16 equal and consecutive semi-annual installments (which implies a 3.5 year grace period). The loan was insured by Sinosure. The Government of Gabon also issued a sovereign guarantee for 25% of the face value of the loan on July 14, 2011. This project involved the construction of the Moanda Metallurgical Complex (CCM) near the town of Moanda within Haut-Ogooué Province in south-east Gabon.   The complex consists of two plants: a silico-manganese plant with a production capacity of 65,000 tons (which has been operational since August 2014) and a metal manganese plant with a production capacity of 20,000 tons (which has been operational since January 2015).  Construction began in April 2009, and the President of the Republic of Gabon Ali Bongo Ondimba inaugurated the CCM on June 12, 2015.  This $400 million project was initiated as part of a partnership between Eramet and Gabon’s state-owned mining company Société Equatoriale des Mines (SEM).   ICBC agreed to provide 70% of the financing ($109.9 million) while BNP Paribas agreed to provide the remaining 30% ($47.1 million).

The Olkaria IV geothermal field is located Naivasha District and Nakuru County. It is situated just inside the Hell’s Gate National Park, on the eastern edge of the Eastern Rift Valley.   The project was implemented by Kenya's Geothermal Development Company (GDC) — a government special purpose vehicle (SPV) for geothermal development — in collaboration with Great Wall Drilling Company, Kenya Electricity Generating Company Ltd (KenGen), and Kenya's Ministry of Energy & Petroleum. Project implementation commenced on July 23, 2012. It was completed on October 17, 2014.   However, there are indications that the project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a report from Kenya’s Auditor General for the Year Ended June 30, 2021, '[t]he wells were drilled between the year 2011 and 2015 and have never been connected to any plant for generation of power. [Kenya Electricity Generating Company PLC, which is also known as KenGen] has in the meantime continued to pay the principal sum and interest [of the loan] while no corresponding revenue has been realized to date. Further, [KenGen] Management has not given the details of when the wells will likely be utilized in the generation of power. As a result, there is no value for money obtained on the investment [...].' 1. This project is also known as Olkaria IV--140MW Geothermal Field Production Drilling Project.

The proceeds from the PBC were used to finance 85% of the cost of the commercial contract with ZTE. The Government of Nigeria agreed to fund the remaining 15% ($70.5 million) itself. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is September 21, 2030.   As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank PBC (loan) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($399.5 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $89.04 million and principal repayments worth $92.19 million to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $307.31 million.   The Nigeria National Public Security Communication System Project had five subcomponents. The first subcomponent was a Global Open Trunking Architecture (GoTa) Sub-system, which is a CDMA-based voice and data telecommunications system with national coverage that operates through Mobile Switch Centers (MSCs) in Lagos and Abuja, 12 Base Station Controller (BSCs), 675 Base Transceiver Station (BTSs) and 21 Microwave repeaters. The GoTa system supported the deployment of 1.5 million subscriber lines. The second subcomponent was Video Surveillance Subsystem, which involved the installation of approximately 2,000 solar-powered CCTV cameras in Abuja and Lagos. The CCTV cameras were reportedly installed to monitor and reduce criminal activities including attacks, kidnappings and killings. The third subcomponent was a Video Conferencing Subsystem, which provided a platform for real time video conferencing for the Nigeria Police Force across all commands and the Force Headquarter. The fourth subcomponent was an E-policing Subsystem, which facilitated the deployment of E-policing databases. The fifth subcomponent was the Coalition Emergency Response subsystem, which provided a platform for national emergency communication using the short code of 911 for emergency and distress calls and 912 for anonymous security information. This subsystem also reportedly enabled the carried the security agencies to carry out coordinated responses.   This project commenced in 2011 and it was completed in 2012, but its precise completion date is unknown. It has, however, been plagued by controversies and various problems. In 2011, Nigeria’s House of Representatives investigated compliance with due process in the award of the contract and the execution of the project by ZTE Corporation. In 2014, Nigeria’s Federal High Court ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to investigate if there was corruption in the contract awarding process. Then, in 2019, Nigeria’s Federal High Court approved the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project to investigate the Federal Government’s use of the loan proceeds.    After the completion of the project, the communication network laid idle for many years because of the high cost of administering and maintaining it. The network was also badly vandalized. In reference to the Video Surveillance Subsystem, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) has reporting that ‘virtually all its infrastructure had been removed or destroyed by motorists through accidents.’ In 2018, Nigeria’s federal government announced plans to revive the National Public Security Communication System, including the vandalized CCTV cameras in Abuja and Lagos. 1.

This loan, which is captured via Project ID#33736, carries a maturity length of 30 years. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $70.4 million commercial (EPC) contract between the Government of Zanzibar and Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG), which was signed on October 22, 2009. As of May 2018, China Eximbank had disbursed $56 million from the loan to the Government of Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance and Planning. To facilitate the repayment of the loan, an escrow account was established and revenues from the expanded airport are to be deposited in the account (with a percentage paid to China Eximbank and another percentage to the airport operator).   The purpose of the project was to expand Abeid Amani Karume International Airport (AAKIA) on Pemba Island. The airport construction work involved an expansion of the runway, a new apron of 100,000 square meters (to replace the existing 21,000 sure meter apron), a 17,000 square meter terminal, the building of Terminal II, a utility house, a generator house (i.e. small power station), fire fighting water tanks, civil works, electrical and mechanical installations, fittings, fixtures and furnishings, operational and immigration counters, passenger seats and associated accessories.   Beijing Architectural & Engineering Design Co. Ltd (BAED) was the contractor responsible for project design and Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The design of the project began in 2010 after a ‘design and build’ contract was signed in 2009. The feasibility study for the project, which included an environmental impact assessment was carried out by the Government of Zanzibar, after which point China Eximbank hired a consultant and ‘improved on it’. No local companies or technical staff from the Government of Zanzibar or Zanzibar Airports Authority (ZAA) were part of the project design team. After site clearing activities commenced in September 2010, construction began on February 1, 2011. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion after 18 months. However, eighteen months later (July 2012), the project was still not complete. After after spending roughly half of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan ($35.2 million) on building the new terminal, it was found that while the airport was designed for Code E aircrafts like Boeing 777, there wasn’t sufficient space between the taxiway and the aerobridge. This incredibly expensive mistake was attributed to a lack of oversight and coordination and resulted in the dismissal of the Turkish consultant hired for the project. The Turkish consultant was replaced with a French consulting company — Aeroport De Paris Engineering (ADPI) — that provided two mitigation options. The first involved demolition and restarting construction. The second entailed retaining it and shifting the code to the south. As $35.3 million had already been spent, the second option was deemed more suitable. BCEG blamed the delay in construction to varying expectations of client — from the initial building area of 17,000 square meters, it was later increased to 25,000 square meters, and original capacity of 1.1 million was later augmented to 1.6 million. However, it was found that to complete construction, additional funds of $58 million were required, which increased the overall cost of the project to $128.147 million. Due to failures incurred during project design and the substantial cost increase, the project was suspended in 2013 and later again in 2015.  According to the project coordinator for the Government of Zanzibar, suspension of the project was a big blow: ‘We had told the President that we would do it before elections in October 2015’, the coordinator said. Although there were fears that China Eximbank would not release the additional funds and the project would have to be abandoned midway, a high level official from the Communist Party of China who visited the project site assured its completion. Importantly, however, it needs to be noted that the contractor (BCEG) for the project continued working on the site even after China Eximbank had suspended funding. According to an official who spoke to a group of researchers (Tong Wu, Jumanne Gomera and Veda Vaidyanathan) on the condition of anonymity ‘… although 35.2 million was already spent, total value of work done by contractor exceeded 70.4 million. They are working on good faith, although the money hasn’t come through.’ In conversations between the contractor and the new French consultant, ADPI, one of the challenges pointed out was of language. As there were substantial communication lapses between the Tanzanian operator, the French consultant and Chinese contractors, they created their own code names for various components so that ideas do not get lost in translation. ‘It’s like we created own personal dictionary’, said one interviewee (of the research team consisting of Tong Wu, Jumanne Gomera and Veda Vaidyanathan). Conflict of interests between the consultant and the contractor also came to light: ‘the contractor tries to work cheapest while the consultant [emphasizes] the quality, this naturally leads to differences in approach”. In addition to these challenges, there was also a difference in standards. Design and execution of the works comply with local laws and other standards specified in the employer’s requirements while Chinese standards prevail over other local and international standards in remaining areas. Although 90 per cent of Chinese standards are [recognized] by ILAC, IATA, ICAO and the British Standards were applied to the fire and safety systems. The definition of training by the Chinese contractor did not seem to be in sync with that of the officials. ‘We are not here to provide a five year engineering degree...we will provide training on specific parts of machines to those who are already familiar but not provide general training’. However, according to the consultant, the ZAA technicians do not have the capacity to operate and run the terminal as per the required standards. Capacity development, though required, is not part of the contract. Additionally, only a small part of materials such as cement, food, transport services, cables, pipes and aggregates were locally procured. Most of the materials were sourced from China. This was partly because local inputs did not meet quality specifications of the project. It was also pointed out, however, that China Eximbank funding requires Chinese contractors to source some of the material from China. Interestingly, the elevators, which were sourced from a French company, were also manufactured in China. Between December 2010 and September 2011, the project owner repeatedly proposed project design modifications. Then, on December 8, 2011, the President of Zanzibar visited the construction site and expressed a willingness to contract more debt to change the project design and extend the construction period. On March 27, 2012, the project owner organized a delegation to Beijing for further project design modification discussions. Then, on June 8, 2012, the project owner and BCEF agreed on a new budget and signed a revised EPC contract. However, due to various project design modifications and the substantial cost increase, the project was suspended in 2013. Also, a parliamentary session in August 2013, members of Zanzibar’s parliament reportedly expressed outrage at the lack of progress made in opening the new terminal. They also flagged evidence of poor workmanship. Then, in January 2014, construction works were resumed. On January 4, 2015, the expanded parking apron and extended and resurfaced taxiway were formally launched. The project was again suspended in 2015 (for unknown reasons). In May 2017, members of the Zanzibar House of Representatives raised concern over the rapidly increasing cost of the project, alleging corruption. The project was again put on hold.  However, construction works officially resumed on January 31, 2018. Then, in July 2019, lawmakers questioned whether BCEG was building the airport according to international standards. As of November 2019, the project had still only achieved a 51% completion rate and the contractor was aiming to complete construction before Zanzibar’s elections in 2020. China Eximbank, also made it clear that it would not provide any additional funds, so the stakes were high to finish the project on time and within financial constraints. The expanded Abeid Amani Karume International Airport (AAKIA) was officially inaugurated on September 28, 2020 — at almost twice the original cost. The expansion of the airport was originally expected to bring in bigger aircraft, more cargo, and more tourists to the island. Government of Zanzibar officials insisted that there were considerable demand from Arab countries to introduce carriers like Emirates to the island. However, the COVID-19 pandemic all but halted tourism in much of East Africa, calling into question the financial viability of the airport. Revenue projections for the new terminal relied heavily on growing passenger traffic, making it unclear whether Zanzibar will be able to repay its outstanding debts to China Eximbank on schedule.   Then, on  November 3, 2022, China Eximbank and the Government of Tanzania signed an additional (supplementary) loan agreement worth $56.72 million for the Abeid Amani Karume International Airport (AAKIA) Project. This loan is captured via Project ID#95627. 1.

On November 11, 2010, Togolese authorities signed, but not ratify the China Eximbank loan because they had learned that the loan’s financing terms narrowly failed to meet the concessionality requirements under the International Monetary Fund's Extended Credit Facility (ECF) supported program. The Togolese authorities postponed ratification of the loan agreement until the loan’s terms were renegotiated to be consistent with the minimum level of concessionality.   The loan was eventually ratified, and carried the following terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 2%. In 2015, $13,884,880 USD of the proceeds from this loan were disbursed, and in 2016, $4,215,852 of the proceeds were disbursed.

Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe and Wang Gang, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, witnessed the signing of the loan agreement. The Phase 1 GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity and a 5 year grace period. However, according to the the 2018 and 2019 Blue Book Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure published by Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, its face value was later revised to RMB 286,080,176.66. The Phase 1 GCL’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $42,068,995.10 as of 2021. The Chinese Government also provided an RMB 50 million grant for Phase 1, which is captured via Project ID#62417.  The purpose of Phase 1 was to facilitate the country’s transition to second generation (2G) and third generation (3G) phone technology by expanding the coverage and capacity of NetOne’s network and more than doubling its subscriber base. NetOne Zimbabwe is a company that is wholly owned by the Zimbabwean government. It is one of three mobile phone operators in the country. It used the proceeds of the Phase 1 GCL to purchase equipment from Huawei Technologies and implement network upgrades to wireless broadband stations, while expanding coverage to remote geographic areas lacking service. Its ultimate goal was to reach 7 million subscribers. During Phase 1, a Broadband and Ascot Packet Core Switching Centre in Bulawayo was completed and officially inaugurated on December 7, 2011. By 2012, NetOne had successfully launched mobile broadband and 3G service in Zimbabwe.

34031,"China Eximbank extends $6 billion master loan facility agreement to Angola (Linked to Project ID#66690) On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on November 18, 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola entered into a $6 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA), which was amended and reissued on June 8, 2011. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 3.6708% interest rate, a 17.5 year maturity, and a 2.5 year grace period. Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The amount available under the MLFA was a function of the number of barrels of oil per day sold by Sonangol to Chinese importers designated by China Eximbank. The amount available under the MLFA increased from a minimum of $3.0 billion to a maximum of $6.0 billion, with increments of $1.0 billion, depending on the number of barrels per day sold by Sonangol to China Eximbank's designated importers.

40,"ICBC provides $825 million export credit facility for 600MW Morupule B Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#98173) On June 15, 2009, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) — a state-owned power company in Botswana — signed a $825,048,559.40 export credit facility agreement for the 600MW Morupule B Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 3.5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.6% margin. The borrower was expected to repay the loan between December 2012 to June 2029. It was also expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a $970 million commercial (EPC) contract with China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), which was signed in November 2008.   Sinosure and World Bank insured the buyer's credit loan (export credit facility) and the Government of Botswana’s Ministry of Finance also provided a sovereign guarantee. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance of $33 million (equivalent to one principal and interest repayment/installment) in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The Government of Republic of Botswana funded the DSRA with P300 million while Botswana Power Corporation paid the balance of P48 million.   The total cost of the Morupule B Power Project was $1.6623 billion. It was financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. ICBC contributed $825 million of debt financing, while the World Bank, and the African Development Bank contributed $136.4 million and $202.5 million of debt financing, respectively. The 30% equity contribution ($498.4 million) came from Botswana Power Corporation and the Government of Botswana.   In addition to the long-term (20-year) export credit facility, ICBC provided a short-term $140 million equity bridge loan to the project sponsor (BPC) to ensure that it could meet its equity contribution requirement. The borrowing terms that applied to the equity bridge loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was guaranteed by Standard Bank.  Standard Bank also provided 20-year currency and interest rate hedging for the export credit facility – a cross-currency swap designed to convert US dollar funding into fixed rate synthetic Botswana Pula, thus minimizing BPC's exposure to adverse movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, and enabling the sponsor to align loan currency with the currency of its revenue stream for the full repayment period.  The project involved the construction of a 600MW coal-fired power plant consisting of 4x150MW units — that uses circulating fluidized bed technology — for domestic power generation purpose. The 600MW Morupule B power plant is located in the township of Palapye, northeast of Gaborone, and it geographically adjacent to the existing 132MW Morupule A power plant. It sources feedstock from the same mine as the existing 132MW Morupule A plant. The project has three main components: the Morupule B Power Station; a 400kV Morupule B–Phokoje transmission system and associated sub-stations linking the plant to the BPC grid; and a 35-borehole well-field and associated water reticulation system. The coal is sourced from the Morupule coal mine, which is the only major operating coal mine in Botswana.  The Morupule coal mine is operated by Morupule Colliery Limited, a subsidiary of Debswana Diamond Company.   China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC) was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Shenyang Blower Works (Group) Co., Ltd (SBW) also supported the project as a subcontractor.  Site and contractor’s camp accommodation facilities as well as bush clearing activities started in early June 2009 and were effectively completed by the end of July 2009, which facilitated CNEEC-SBW to undertake Topographical Survey and Geotechnical Investigation to confirm the design parameters associated with the in-situ ground geological data at the site area. The erection of the contractor’s camp facilities started in November 2009. The camp had the capacity to accommodate approximately 1,500 staff. The project's official EPC contract commencement date was April 29, 2009. However, the project's groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until February 19, 2010. It was originally envisaged that the power plant plant would become operational by October 2012. However, the project experienced significant delays and CNEEC did not hand over the four power generation units to the BPC until May 4, 2014. Then, in October 2014, three of the four power generation units broke down, and the Government of Botswana had needed to consider importing energy from South Africa. The power plant was originally expected to operate at the annual capacity factor of about 80 percent, with annual gross generation of about 4,200 gigawatt-hour (GWh). However, the plant’s capacity factor was closer to 50 percent, reflecting poor availability and unreliability of the units due to forced outages. Units 1-4 had the capacity to produce 600MW, but they only operated at 21 percent capacity producing only 130MW. According to BPC's 2019 Annual Report, BPC signed a Defects Remediation Agreement with CNEEC to remedy the plant's defects, which was expected to result in the remediation of all plant defects in a phased manner between 2019 and January 2023.   Efforts were also undertaken to expand the plant’s power generation capacity to 900MW after a tender for construction of two additional units (Unit 5 and 6) was awarded to a joint venture between Japanese Marubeni and South Korea’s Posco Energy.  1.

China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) was the source of funding.   Phase 1 involved the construction of a 10,000-seat stadium — equipped with FIFA-certified synthetic grass, a running track, changing rooms, press and physiotherapy rooms, medical and security offices, and a public broadcasting system — in the town of Monte Vaca within the Achada São Filipe municipality.

201,"China Eximbank provides $52.05 million preferential buyer's credit for Phase 1 of the Cameroon Fiber Optic Transmission Backbone Project (Linked to Project ID#36246) On July 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Cameroon Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO.(2009)11 TOTAL NO.(73)] worth $52,050,000 (CFA 31 billion) for Phase 1 of the Fiber Optic Transmission Backbone Project (or 光纤骨干传输网项目). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, and a 5-year grace period. MINEPAT then on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Cameroon’s state-owned telecoms operator, CamTel, which in turn use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $61,224,308 commercial contract [No.2007/GG/DG/CPM-AG/CAMTEL] with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd (that was signed September 5, 2007 and amended on March 10. 2009). As of December 31, 2020, the PBC had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 19.6 billion. Its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 29 billion as of December 31, 2016, CFA 24 billion as of December 31, 2017, CFA 23 billion as of December 31, 2018, and CFA 22 billion as of December 31, 2019.   The purpose of this project was to construct a national fiber-optic backbone that connects ten regions and around 100 district and department capitals. This project entered implementation on December 22, 2009 and was completed on April 29, 2011.  The Cameroon Fiber Optic Transmission Backbone Project was implemented in 3 phases. The first phase (captured via Project ID#201) started in 2009 and ended in 2011. The second phase, which involved laying of 3,200 kilometers of fiber optic cable in the northern part of Cameroon (Maroua), started in 2011 and ended in 2013. The third phase (captured via Project #36246) began in February 2015, was completed in 2017, and involved laying of 3,950 kilometers of fiber optic cable. As of 2017, about 12,000 kilometers of fiber cables had been laid across Cameroon, but the project was still in progress as the government wants at least 20,000 kilometers of fiber cables around Cameroon (FOSMN).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Cameroon Fiber Optic Transmission Backbone Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’ 1.

The borrowing terms were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% management fee, and a 0.30% commitment fee. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract (CAM-CAMC/SPORTS/001-1) between China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (CMEC) and the Cameroon Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Development, which was signed on June 10, 2009. As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 16.3 billion.   CMEC was responsible for the design, materials, construction, installation, commissioning, and training for the major structure, decoration, an awning and its steel structure, water supply, and drainage system, an extra-low voltage supply system, and a low voltage supply system.

There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Bafoussam and Limbe Stadiums Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’ 1.

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% administration fee (management fee). The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 75% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between ERA and CCCC, which was signed on January 22, 2014. $143 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#30886), and $190 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID #36251).   As of March 16, 2021, the $332 million PBC had achieved a 92% disbursement rate ($306,388,654.06 of $333 million). According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia (on March 18, 2021), China Eximbank made 16 loan disbursements (worth $306,388,654.06) through the $333 million PBC between 2014 and 2021: a $100,707,143.90 disbursement on June 26 2014, a $40,941,780.28 disbursement on November 27, 2014, a $25,384,969.23 disbursement on December 22, 2014, a $15,133,515.73 disbursement on June 12, 2015, a $24,221,555.29 disbursement on June 23, 2015, a $8,858,069.08 disbursement on September 22, 2015, a $12,870,031.74 disbursement on October 23, 2015, a $21,763,228.43 disbursement on February, 29, 2016, a $15,093,235.16 disbursement on August 19, 2016, a $15,901,936.27 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a $3,617,707.32 disbursement on June 14, 2017, a $3,317,569.64 disbursement on June 22, 2017, a $4,129,676.75 disbursement on June 23, 2017, a $5,861,882.71 disbursement on December 24, 2019, a $8,338,128.14 disbursement on March 15, 2021, and a $248,224.39 disbursement on March 16, 2021. The total estimated cost of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was $612 million.   The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.    The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project’s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project’s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014. The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road — with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide — that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project’s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor. Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016.   After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.’  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.  1.

The palace was destroyed during Guinea-Bissau’s 1998-1999 civil war. According to June 2018 email correspondence between AidData’s Executive Director and the Director General of the Office of the Secretary of State for Planning and Regional Integration in Guinea-Bissau, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce provided a loan worth $7,599,860 USD to the Government of Guinea-Bissau to support the Presidential Palace Rehabilitation Project. China’s Ministry of Commerce was the funding source and it administers the country’s interest-free loan program, so AidData assumes that it issued an interest-free loan in support of this project.   The Presidential Palace Rehabilitation Project had two primary components: the restoration of the existing presidential palace (“the main building”) and the new construction of a new presidential advisory building in the city of Bissau. The new office building includes 31 offices, two meeting rooms, a tea room, and 4 public restrooms, with a construction area of 1,300 square meters. The new office building is also equipped with a generator room and 7 offices. The Presidential Palace covers an area of ​​2,471 square meters, and its main building, the Presidential Residence, covers an area of ​​1,171 square meters.

On October 20, 2011, Guinea-Bissau’s President and Prime Minister and China’s Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau attended the groundbreaking ceremony. The groundbreaking ceremony was held near the Heroes’ Square in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau’s capital. Then, on March 2, 2012, the Chinese Ambassador to Guinea-Bissau, Li Baojun, and the Economic and Commercial Counselor Ju Chaoqing, visited and inspected the project. At the time, the construction period was expected to be one year.

The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 1,026,923,076.92. The loan was provided with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, an 8 year grace period, and a 20.25 year maturity (final maturity date: March 21, 2030).    The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 41,076,923 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 82,153,846.16 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 821,538,461.54 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 739,384,615.38 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 657,230,769.23 as of June 30, 2022  The primary objective of the Nairobi-Thika Highway Improvement Project was to the expansion of the former dual carriageway (four-lane) Thika Road into six to eight lanes with dual service lanes for each side in most of the sections of the highway. The 50km highway is located in the northeast of the Nairobi Metropolitan Region (NMR) and it extends from Nairobi City Center to Thika District. The trunk road currently serves as a main cargo route and an important metropolitan, regional and international transit link and is part of the classified international trunk road A2, which originates in Nairobi City Center and extends to Moyale, Ethiopia. The road also acts as a main artery for various satellite towns and economic hubs that lie along and near the corridor, including Ruaraka, Kasarani, Kiambu Town, Githurai, Ruiru, Juja, and Thika.   The project consisted of 3 lots and it was co-financed by the African Development Bank, China Eximbank, and the Government of Kenya. China Eximbank funded Lot 3 (the 23.8 km road segment from Kenyatta University to Thika) and the African Development Bank and the Government of Kenya financed Lots 1 and 2. The first lot (Lot 1) comprised the rehabilitation and upgrading of three Nairobi City Arterial Connectors to the Nairobi - Thika Road (A2) for a total of 12.4 km. The components were: Forest Road from Pangani to A104 Museum Roundabout (3.6 km); Muranga Road from Muthaiga to A104 at University Way Roundabout (4.5 km); and Kariakor Road from Pangani to A104 at Haile Selasse Road Roundabout (4.3 km). The second lot (Lot 2) covered the rehabilitation and expansion of the 14.1 km Muthaiga - Kenyatta University stretch on the Nairobi - Thika road (km 3+900 - km 18 + 00). The third lot (Lot 3) involved the rehabilitation and upgrading of the 23.88 km Kenyatta University (km 18+000) to Thika (km 41+880) section of the road.   3 Chinese contractors were responsible for project implementation: Shengli, Sinohydro Corp and China Wu Yi. China Wu Yi worked on Lot 1, Sinohydro worked on Lot 2, and Shengli worked on Lot 3. The project was initiated on January 22, 2009, and completed on October 11, 2011. The project was originally expected to reach completion, as per the project implementation schedule, on July 21, 2011.    This project was designed with a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism. Baseline data collected at the beginning of the project were compared with enplane data collected at project at completion. The indicators are largely “SMART”: measures of mobility assessed through changes in traffic flows; accessibility, tracked using journey speed survey data at the beginning and at completion of the project; increased inter-regional trade flows between Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, measured through secondary economic data in 2007 and assessed against target flows in 2011; traffic accident data in 2007 assessed against crash data in 2013; and average land values within the project corridor measured before and after the project. The outcome data at project completion were impressive: traffic flows increased from 85,000 vehicles per day in 2007 to 123,000 vehicles per day in 2012 (45% increase in mobility); journey speeds rose from 8km/hour to at least 45km/hour in sections with the highest registered traffic; the number of traffic accidents fell; and land values rose from $23 thousand to $46 thousand per acre in Thika, and even more in areas closer to the city like Kasarani—from $46 thousand up to $500 thousand per acre. 1.

The loan included the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: September 21, 2029), a grace period of 5 years (first repayment date: March 21, 2015), an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a management fee of 1%, and a commitment fee of 0.75%. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial contract [number SCG-CLL 001] between Shanghai Construction (Group) General Company and Malawi's Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Housing, which was signed on December 19, 2008.   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 336,000,000 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 42,000,000 until 2029.

This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).

This 'resources-for-credit' cooperation package is backed by future revenues from the sale of oil exports. Each subsidiary buyer’s credit loan (BCL) issued through the framework agreement carries a 15-year maturity and 5.6% interest rate.  One of the subsidiary loans approved through this agreement in 2009 was a $612,305,397 BCL for the 405 MW Al-Fulah Gas-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The proceeds of the BCL were used to be used by the borrower finance 90% of the cost of a $680,339,330 commercial (EPC) contract signed on December 24, 2008 with China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (CMC).   The project involved the installation of three 135 MW power generating units at a gas-fired power plant in the city of Al-Fulah.  Its ultimate goal was to supply electricity to the entire Kodorfan region through an electricity transmission line than runs from the city of El-Obeid (in central Sudan within North Kordofan State) to Al-Fulah (or al-Fula or EI Fula or الفولة) in West Kordofan State. The transmission line project was funded through a separate China Eximbank PBC (as captured via Project ID#979).  CMC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its EPC contract went into effect on November 16, 2009. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on March 24, 2010.   However, the loan that supported this project underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations, which led to major project implementation delays.  According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral.  Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). In November 2012, the Sudanese Minister of Electricity and Dams, Osama Abdulla, told the Sudanese Parliament that work on the Al-Fulah Gas-Fired Power Plant Construction Project had halted due to the Sudanese Government failing to make oil shipments to China repay its debts the loans. At the time of this work stoppage, $366.5 million had been disbursed through the China Eximbank BCL.   As of 2017, the project was still stalled because Sudan’s Central Bank had not paid the Chinese contractor responsible for implementation in a timely manner. The project was officially cancelled by the Government of Sudan in 2018; however, it was later reinstated by the Transitional Government of Sudan in October 2019.  According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022. 1.

Then, on March 21, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon’s Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development signed an RMB 170,513,606 (CFA 14 billion) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase I of the Douala (Yato) Water Supply Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, and a 0% default (penalty) interest) rate.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a commercial contract between CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd (CGCOC) and the Government of Cameroon’s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources, which was signed on November 13, 2007. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (GCL) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 8 billion. Its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 12 billion as of December 31, 2016, CFA 10 billion as of December 31, 2017, CFA 9 billion as of December 31, 2018, and CFA 8 billion as of December 31, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to build a water treatment plant with a capacity of 50,000 ton/day and a 20 km long water distribution pipeline in the village of Ayatto (Yato), which is located on the outskirts of Douala along the River Mungo.   CGCOC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Camwater, Cameroon's state-owned water utility company, reportedly provided XAF 7 billion of counterpart funding for Phase 1 and was involved in construction activities. Works began on January 18, 2008 and were completed on June 25, 2010.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Douala (Yato) Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’ 1.

The proceeds from this loan was to be used for the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $73 million commercial contract for Phase 2.   Phases 1 and 2 involved the construction of a fiber optic cable (“backbone”) network (measuring more than 3000 km in length) that connects the cities of Pointe-Noire, Makoua, Dolisie, Brazzaville, Oyo and Ouesso (through an underground fibre optic cable runs between Pointe-Noire and Ouesso and between Makoua and Ouesso and through an overhead cable that piggybacks on the National Electricity Company’s EHV electricity transmission lines linked to the Moukoukoulou and Imboulou hydroelectric dams); the construction of several additional fiber optic cable segments (“branches”) that connect to the backbone (a 130 km segment from Ngo to Djambala, a 70 km segment from Loudima to Sibiti, and an 80 km segment from Oyo to Boundji); and the construction of fiber optic cable loops around the cities of Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, Oyo, and all of the country’s departmental capitals (measuring 700 km in length).

According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68 percent stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32 percent. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”. Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects. The April 2008 agreement specified that ownership of the Sicomines joint venture was allocated such that CREC holds 43% ownership of the joint venture, Sinohydro holds 25%, Gécamines holds 20%, and a Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) holds 12%.   On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which change the ownership allocation to CREC: 28%, Sinohydro: 20%, China Metallurgical Group Corporation: 20%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership allocation to CREC: 33%, Sinohydro: 30%, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt: 5%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. Project ID#450 provides a list of the infrastructure projects and subsidiary loans that have been approved to date. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” it was reported that the Chinese company consortium were to provide $2.9 billion in loans to cover (1) a $32 million loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) $50 million loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; and (3) to provide a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. The $2.9 billion was ultimately provided through a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity, a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines, and a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines. Project ID#73204 captures the interest-free shareholder loan from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. Project ID#73145 captures the loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Project ID#91873.

At the end of Fiscal Year 2013, Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL) disclosed that it had received loan disbursements worth $423,889,454. However, it did not disclose if these disbursements came from the China Eximbank loan, the interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and Sinohydro Corporation, both loans, or other loans/sources. The Congolese government agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the ‘infrastructure loan’ and the ‘mining loan’ from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms.   However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#73145). The sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan was left in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and the Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi.    Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013, and on November 6, 2015 the first phase of the mining project was completed. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020. Upon completion of the project’s second phase, the mine’s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity). According to the Sino-Congolese Program Coordination and Monitoring Office (BCPSC), by the end of 2020, the $2.0299 billion China Eximbank mining loan had achieved a 102.8% disbursement rate ($2,088,350,000 out of $2,029,900,000). In total, the loan disbursed $175 million in 2009, $265.3 million in 2010, $7.93 million in 2011, $190.65 million in 2012, $208.91 million in 2013, $526.2 million in 2014, $154.68 million in 2015, $18.74 million in 2016, $11.26 million in 2017, $6.8 million in 2018, $45.76 million in 2019, and $477.11 million in 2020. According to BCPSC, Sicomines SARL made debt service payments (worth $550.14 million) on the $2.0299 billion China Eximbank mining loan between 2009 and 2020: $8.28 million in 2009, $19.997 million in 2010, $20.49 million in 2011, $7.22 million in 2012, $25.31 million in 2013, $54.31 million in 2014, $68.96 million in 2015, $72.28 million in 2016, $69.61 million in 2017, $66.11 million in 2018, $62.7 million in 2019, and $74.4 million in 2020.

73145,"China Eximbank provides $2.0299 billion loan for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Sicomines Copper and Cobalt Mining Project (Linked to Project ID#450, #73204, #91875, and #91873) On September 17, 2007, a consortium consisting of China Eximbank, China Railways Construction Company (CREC), and Sinohydro and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a “protocol d’accord” (or “项目换资源协议”). According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68 percent stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32 percent. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”. Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects. The April 2008 agreement specified that ownership of the Sicomines joint venture was allocated such that CREC holds 43% ownership of the joint venture, Sinohydro holds 25%, Gécamines holds 20%, and a Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) holds 12%.   On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which change the ownership allocation to CREC: 28%, Sinohydro: 20%, China Metallurgical Group Corporation: 20%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership allocation to CREC: 33%, Sinohydro: 30%, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt: 5%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. Project ID#450 provides a list of the infrastructure projects and subsidiary loans that have been approved to date. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” it was reported that the Chinese company consortium were to provide $2.9 billion in loans to cover (1) a $32 million loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) $50 million loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; and (3) to provide a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. The $2.9 billion was ultimately provided through a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity, a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines, and a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines. Project ID#73204 captures the interest-free shareholder loan from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. Project ID#73145 captures the loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Project ID#91873.  The $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Project ID#91875. At the end of Fiscal Year 2013, Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL) disclosed that it had received loan disbursements worth $423,889,454. However, it did not disclose if these disbursements came from the China Eximbank loan, the interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and Sinohydro Corporation, both loans, or other loans/sources. The Congolese government agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the ‘infrastructure loan’ and the ‘mining loan’ from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms.   However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#73145). The sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan was left in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and the Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi.  Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013, and on November 6, 2015 the first phase of the mining project was completed. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020. Upon completion of the project’s second phase, the mine’s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity).   According to the Sino-Congolese Program Coordination and Monitoring Office (BCPSC), by the end of 2020, the $2.0299 billion China Eximbank mining loan had achieved a 102.8% disbursement rate ($2,088,350,000 out of $2,029,900,000). In total, the loan disbursed $175 million in 2009, $265.3 million in 2010, $7.93 million in 2011, $190.65 million in 2012, $208.91 million in 2013, $526.2 million in 2014, $154.68 million in 2015, $18.74 million in 2016, $11.26 million in 2017, $6.8 million in 2018, $45.76 million in 2019, and $477.11 million in 2020. According to BCPSC, Sicomines SARL made debt service payments (worth $550.14 million) on the $2.0299 billion China Eximbank mining loan between 2009 and 2020: $8.28 million in 2009, $19.997 million in 2010, $20.49 million in 2011, $7.22 million in 2012, $25.31 million in 2013, $54.31 million in 2014, $68.96 million in 2015, $72.28 million in 2016, $69.61 million in 2017, $66.11 million in 2018, $62.7 million in 2019, and $74.4 million in 2020. BCPSC also reported in 2020 that Sicomines SARL was scheduled to make the following debt service payments on the China Eximbank mining loan between 2021 and 2025: $106.8 million in 2021, $106.8 million in 2022, $106.8 million in 2023, $106.8 million in 2024, and $82.8 million in 2025.

The agreement was signed by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui and China's ambassador Hxue Jinwei. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogooué river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogooué, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie minière de l’Ogooué’s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 15, 2008, and it was originally anticipated that the construction process will be completed in 54 months (May 15, 2013).   The dam was impounded on April 30, 2013.  Then, the four power generating units went into operation on August 5, 2013. The dam, water diversion system and other civil works passed final inspection by the project owner on July 22, 2014. The power generator set and auxiliary equipment also passed final inspection by the project owner on August 9, 2014, effectively marking the completion of the project.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.

Phase 1 of the project involved the rollout of UGNet, a secure and reliable information infrastructure backbone that connects all the major buildings on the University of Ghana’s Legon Campus, and provides internet connectivity, email and IP-based services to its faculty and departments. In addition, connectivity was provided to the Accra-City Campus and the College of Health Sciences at Korle-bu. Phase 1 also involved the provision of ICT equipment, including desktops, laptops, servers and projectors to the University of Ghana. The ultimate objective of this project was to improve the quality of teaching and learning and to increase access to education.   Tsinghua Unigroup was the contractor responsible for implementation. Phase I was officially launched on December 8, 2009, and budget documents from the Government of Ghana demonstrate that China Eximbank disbursed $1.62 million for this project by September 2009 and an additional $2.46 million (out of an expected $2.58 million) by September 2010. This project was ultimately completed, but its precise completion date is unknown.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the University of Ghana ICT-Enabled Distance Learning Project at the University of Ghana may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

Then, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.  In June 2013, a steering committee for Phase 2 of this project was established. Phase 2 was also financed by China Eximbank (as captured via Project ID#30481). 1. This project is also known as the ICT ‐ Enabled Distance Education Project. The Chinese project title is 紫光软件加纳远程教育项目 or 清华紫光远程教育项目. 2. One official source suggests that this loan was financed through a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) rather than a government concessional loan (GCL). This issue warrants further investigation. 3.

30801,"China Eximbank provides RMB 2.1 billion government concessional loan for Bui Dam Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#183, #30709, #30086, #95483, #95484) On September 25, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $293,506,062 for the Bui Dam Construction Project. Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans. 1. The Chinese project title is 加纳布维水电站项目. 2. The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Bui Dam Construction Project is CH-GH-BUI-2007.  The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project is CH-GH-BUI-2013. 3. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the aggregate value of the two supplementary China Eximbank loans as Gh-DCMIS as $168,400,000 rather than $151,600,000. The Gh-DCMIS also identifies the loan commitment date as January 29, 2013 rather than April 30, 2012. These issues warrant further investigation. 4. Loan repayment for the BCL involved a cocoa sales agreement between Genertec Corporation of China and the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) for up to 30,000 metric tons of cocoa beans per year until the dam became operational. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were placed in an escrow account with China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational, the cocoa agreement ended and 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Any excess funds in the escrow account could be withdrawn by Government Ghana, or they could stay in the account and earn interest. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to fall within a range of $0.035 and $0.055 cents per kilowatt-hour (kW/h). According to the World Bank, the average electricity tariff in Africa is much higher — at $0.13 per kW/h. 5. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Bui Dam Construction Project as December 2, 2013. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 25, 2007 and September 1, 2012, respectively. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project as December 31, 2017. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 29, 2013 and December 2, 2013, respectively. 6.

1112,"China Eximbank provides $104.4 million preferential buyer's credit for Nairobi Northern and Eastern Bypass Project On December 15, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a $108 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Northern and Eastern Bypass Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to $104,400,000. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 7-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The loan was scheduled for semi-annual repayment in equal installments between January 30, 2015, and January 21, 2029.  The borrower was expected to use the proceed of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a RMB 740 million commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   The borrower made principal repayments worth $3,600,000 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and $7,200,000 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022. The loan’s amount outstanding was $64,800,000 as of June 30, 2020, $57,600,000 as of June 30, 2021, and $50,400,000 as of June 30, 2022.   The project sought to build a 52 km road in Nairobi. The project supported a 21 km northern bypass segment and a 31 km eastern bypass segment. The northern bypass road starts in a neighborhood called Ruaka, approximately 16 kilometres (10 mi), north-west of the central business district of Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. From there, the road travels in a general easterly direction through Runda. It briefly crosses into Kiambu County, passes underneath Kiambu Road, re-enters Nairobi County and continues to a neighborhood called Marurui. At Marurui, the road takes a north-easterly direction, crosses Kamiti Road, then passes through Kahawa and re-enters Kiambu Couty, to end at the Nairobi Eastern Bypass Highway in Ruiru. The eastern bypass road starts at the junction of the Nairobi–Mombasa Road and Airport North Road, in Embakasi, immediately west of Nairobi International Airport, approximately 12 kilometres (7 mi) south-east of the city centre.The road then loops through the south-eastern suburbs of Nairobi, skirting the northern edges of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, through Ruai. The road then crosses from Nairobi County, into Kiambu County and then turns westwards, passes underneath the Thika Highway and ends at the Ruiru Kamiti Road, at a place called Ruiru Road Junction.  CRBC was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction on the Bypass Project began on April 18, 2009. The project was completed and delivered to Kenya Urban Roads Authority on March 30, 2012. The project aimed to build a 53 km road in Nairobi. The project consisted of a 21 km northern bypass segment and a 32 km eastern bypass segment.  1.

One of these projects was the Modern Customs Scanning Equipment Acquisition Project. This agreement was signed by China’s Ambassador to Namibia Ren Xiaoping and Nambia’s Minister of Finance Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila.   Then, in 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Namibia signed an RMB 300 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Modern Customs Scanning Equipment Acquisition Project.

The Modern Customs Scanning Equipment Acquisition Project has been plagued by domestic political controversy and a criminal investigation regarding a possible kickback scheme involving the $12,828,800 advance payment. Anti-corruption investigators allege that, five days after the May 2008 contract was signed, Nuctech Company Ltd. secretly entered into a $12.8 million contract with Teko Trading CC (“Teko”), which is a company owned by two Namibians (Teckla Lameck and Jerobeam Kongo Mokaxwa). Teko was allegedly tasked with pushing for a higher price for the scanners and using their political access to “expedite prompt payments”, according to a copy of the contract submitted to a court in Namibia. Shortly after the securing the contract with Nuctech Company Ltd., Teckla Lameck (a former chairperson of Namibia’s Public Service Commission), Jerobeam Kongo Mokaxwa and a Chinese co-conspirator (Yang Fan) allegedly went on a spending spree, purchasing houses, farms, and cars. The pending criminal case is political and diplomatically sensitive because, at the time that these contracts were signed, Hu Haifeng (to son of President Hu Jintao) was the head of the Nuctech Company Ltd. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that was released in July 2020, SAIS-CARI identifies this project as being supported by a $100 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) from China Eximbank with the following terms: 20 year maturity, 3 year grace period, 2.5% interest rate.

KNBEPCL is a project company and a wholly owned subsidiary of ZESCO Limited, Zambia’s state-owned power company. The China Eximbank loan to KNBEPCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The loan’s amount outstanding was $268 million as of December 31, 2015, $240.9 million as of December 31, 2016, $214.2 million as of December 31, 2017, $214.2 million as of December 31, 2018, $160.62 million as of December 31, 2019, $133.848 million os of December 31, 2020, $120,464,052 as of June 30, 2021, and $100,002,768 (inclusive of $6,308,506 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022.    The loan was secured by (collateralized against) receivables from Copperbelt Energy Corporation and Chambeshi Mining Company. The proceeds from this loan were used to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract between Sinohydro and ZESCO Limited, which was signed on November 15, 2007. Development Bank of South Africa also provided a $105 million loan for the same project. This project involved an expansion of the power generation capacity of the Kariba North hydroelectric power station through the installation of two new generators. Construction began on November 5, 2008. However, the project encountered a number of problems and delays. In 2009, a fire broke out in one of the generators. Then, in November 2011, it was reported that project completion had been delayed a year due to 'financial constraints'.   The project was ultimately completed on August 21, 2014. An official completion ceremony took place on August 27, 2014. The 1.08GW Kariba North hydroelectric power station is located on the bank of Zambezi River at Kariba in the southern province of Zambia. It includes the Kariba North Bank (KNB) (720MW) power plant and the Kariba North Bank Extension (KNBE) (360MW) power plant. The KNB power plant was developed between 1969 and 1976 as part of the Central African Power Corporation’s (CAPC) development program. The KNBE power plant consists of two 180MW vertical-shaft Francis turbines with a rated discharge 227.6m3/s operating at a head of 89m for each single unit. It has two intake chambers for water at an elevation of 458m. The underground powerhouse is 24m wide and 51m in length. The power generated is transmitted through a 130 km long, 330kV transmission line from the KNBE power plant to the existing Kafue west substation. The power generated from KNBE is purchased by ZESCO Limited under a 20-year long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), which was approved by Zambia’s Energy Regulation Board (ERB) in April 2011. 1.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections.

Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029).  The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA.

Dr. Corkin noted that the second, third and fourth MLFAs were treated more like ceiling increases to the initial facility. Therefore, for the time being, AidData categorizes the second, third, and fourth MLFAs as buyer's credit loans.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029).  The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA.  ILAs approved through the 2007 MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.

On September 28, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $20,613,159.00 buyer’s credit loan agreement under the July 19, 2007 MLFA for 'complementary actions' related to the Caxito Electricity Network (MT, BT, and IP) Rehabilitation and Expansion and 60Kv Quifangondo-Cazenga Transmission Line Rehabilitation Project.   The proceeds of the subsidiary loan were used to partially finance a $49,902,081.20 commercial (EPC) contract with China Machine-Building International Corporation (CMIC).    The purpose of the project was to expand and rehabilitate the electricity network in the city of Caxito and rehabilitate a 60kV transmission line between Quifangondo and Cazenga as well as a substation at Quifangondo-Mabubas.    CMIC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The project reportedly entered implementation, but its precise implementation start and end dates are unknown. 1. The project is referred to as 卡赞卡、齐凡贡多及马布巴变电站修复项目 in Chinese. 2.

Dr. Corkin noted that the second, third and fourth MLFAs were treated more like ceiling increases to the initial facility. Therefore, for the time being, AidData categorizes the second, third, and fourth MLFAs as buyer's credit loans. 3.

11939,"China Eximbank provides RMB 350 million government concessional loan for Cameroon Telecommunications CDMA Project (Linked to Project ID#31230 and ID#91746) On January 31, 2007, the Chinese Government and the Government of Cameroon signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Cameroon Telecommunications CDMA Project . On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Cameroon signed an RMB 350 million (CFA 29 billion) government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. 5 (2007) TOTAL NO. (176)] for the Cameroon Telecommunications CDMA Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2%, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee.   The proceeds of the loan were on-lent by the Government of the Republic of Cameroon to CAMTEL (a state-owned telecommunications and Internet service provider in Cameroon). CAMTEL, as the ‘end-user’ and ultimate borrower, was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial contract (ID# 2006/025/GG/DG/CPM-AG/CAMTEL) between CAMTEL and from Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., which was signed on April 11, 2006. As of December 31, 2020, the CFA 29 billion loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 13.2 billion. Its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 20 billion as of December 31, 2016, CFA 17 billion as of December 31, 2017, CFA 15 billion as of December 31, 2018, and CFA 14 billion as of December 31, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to enable CAMTEL’s acquisition of wireless (CDMA) phone technology and facilitate the installation of 350,000 CDMA lines. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.  was the contractor responsible for implementation. Several sources that this project reached implementation, but it precise implementation start and end dates are unknown. Following trials with 10,000 lines in Yaounde and Douala in 2004, CAMTEL launched a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-based wireless network in September 2005, under the brand name CTPhone, to complement its fixed-line network. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. supplied 20,000 lines in a first phase, which was later expanded to cover some other towns in the south and west of the country. Uptake was reportedly good, with around 28,000 customers signing up within the first year of operation (representing 20% of CAMTEL’s total fixed subscriber base).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Cameroon Telecommunications CDMA Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’ 1.

It also involved the construction of: a new raw water intake to serve both the Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 water treatment plants; two raw water flow distribution structures, a ductile iron pipe (540 ml DN 1200) for the delivery of the total raw water flow for the Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 water treatment plants from the raw water pumping station to the primary distributor; a ductile iron pipe DN 700 for transferring the flow for Djiri 1 from the primary distributor to the secondary distributor; a water treatment system; a treated water tank with a capacity of 4,000 m3 (two compartments of 2,000 m3 each); a treated water pumping station with a capacity of 5,250 m3 / h, power 1,180 kW (i.e. 1,475 kVA), a common reagent building for the two water plants of Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 (the existing reagents building of Djiri 1 being converted into a reagent storage building for Djiri 1 and Djiri 2); two lime water saturators; a chlorine building housing the calcium hypochlorite dosing equipment for the two water plants and an electro chlorination station; a transformer station for the treated water pumping station equipped with two 6300 kVA transformers (including one emergency); a transformer station for filter washing equipment and process equipment, equipped with two 1000 kVA transformers (including one emergency); an electrical substation and an electricity distribution system; a control and supervision system; a television surveillance system; approximately 500 meter of fiber optic cable; a sanitation network; outdoor facilities; on-site accommodations for the staff of the Control Mission and the Administration; and fifteen new housing units (110 m 2 to 170 m 2 ) for operating staff.    The Djiri Water Treatment Distribution Network Project involved efforts to strengthen the treated water distribution network (“le renforcement du réseau de distribution d’eau traitée.”) in the capital city of Brazzaville. More specifically, it involved the rehabilitation of a 10,000 m³ reservoir and a 4,000 m³ water tower; the construction of seven reservoirs (6,000 m 3 , 5,000 m³, 3,500 m³, 3,000 m³, 2,250 m³, 1,250 m³, 300 m³); the construction of four recovery stations (80,000 m3 / d, 3 + 1 pumps 500 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 2,000 kVA; 8,200 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 200 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 630 kVA; 6,800 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 110 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 400 kVA; 1,800 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 30 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 160 kVA); the installation of power supply for recovery stations (laying approximately 2.3 km of 20 kV underground lines); the laying 183,000 ml of pipes for the primary network, including 61,000 ml of ductile iron DN 1000 to DN 500 and 122,000 ml of PVC pipes DN 400 to DN 200; and the installation of a remote management system between the sites of the recovery stations and reservoirs and the supervision room of the Djiri water treatment plants (for the transmission of data on water levels, flow rates).    The Djiri Water Treatment Plant Extension Project involved the rehabilitation (modernization) of a water treatment plant called ‘Djiri 1’ — that was originally built in 1983 and is co-located with the Djiri 2 water treatment plant north of the capital city of Brazzaville — with treated water production capacity of 2,250 m3 per hour [“la réhabilitation de l’usine d’eau existante de Djiri d’une capacité de deux mille deux cents cinquante (2.250) m3 par heure”]. More specifically, it involved civil engineering rehabilitation works (settling tanks, filters, treated water tank, treated water pumping station, annex buildings); the replacement of all existing equipment; and the rehabilitation of the 16 existing accommodations for operating staff.    China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of all three projects. The Djiri Water Treatment Plant Rehabilitation Project formally commenced on July 18, 2010; however, its construction began on November 11, 2009. Its originally anticipated completion date was November 10, 2012, and as of October 2012, it had achieved an 80% completion rate. The Djiri Water Treatment Distribution Network Project commenced on December 7, 2010, and its originally anticipated completion date was November 21, 2013. The Djiri Water Treatment Plant Extension Project commenced on April 4, 2011, and its originally anticipated completion date was April 3, 2014. All three projects were were completed by July 15, 2014. 1. This project is also known as the Djiri 2 Water Treatment Plant Construction Project. The Chinese project title is 维修吉利水厂一期工程. The French project title is Réhabilitation et extension de l’usine de traitement d’eau potable de Djiri or Construction de la nouvelle usine d’eau de Djiri 2 (5.250 m³/h). 2. According to a 2019 report published by the Republic of Congo’s National Assembly, all loans approved under the framework agreement had an interest rate of 0.25%, maturities between 13 years and 20 years, and grace periods between 3 and 5 years. Therefore, since the maturity of the China Eximbank loan for the Djiri Water Treatment Plant Rehabilitation Project is missing, AidData imputes a value (16.5 years) at the middle of the distribution of this maturity range as an approximation. Likewise, since the grace period of the loan is missing, AidData imputes a value (4 years) at the middle of the distribution of this range as an approximation. 3. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it identifies a single $213 million China Eximbank loan for the ‘Djiri; Drinking Water Supply Project’. AidData records the three separate China Eximbank loans for the Djiri Water Treatment Plant Rehabilitation Project, Djiri Water Treatment Plant Extension Project, and Djiri Water Treatment Distribution Network Project that the Congolese authorities disclosed to the World Bank and the World Bank reported in its September 2014 Republic of Congo Economic Update publication. The total total reported cost of these 3 projects is $299,500,000, and China Eximbank reportedly covered 85% of the total cost of these 3 projects. This amount ($254,575,000) is roughly equivalent to the sum of the three China Eximbank loans for the three sub-projects ($253 million).",True,0.7985633

Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).

Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021.

The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans. 1. The Chinese project title is 加纳布维水电站项目. 2. The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Bui Dam Construction Project is CH-GH-BUI-2007.  The Loan/Grant Code in the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS) for the two loans that support the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project is CH-GH-BUI-2013. 3. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the aggregate value of the two supplementary China Eximbank loans as Gh-DCMIS as $168,400,000 rather than $151,600,000. The Gh-DCMIS also identifies the loan commitment date as January 29, 2013 rather than April 30, 2012. These issues warrant further investigation. 4. Loan repayment for the BCL involved a cocoa sales agreement between Genertec Corporation of China and the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) for up to 30,000 metric tons of cocoa beans per year until the dam became operational. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were placed in an escrow account with China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational, the cocoa agreement ended and 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Any excess funds in the escrow account could be withdrawn by Government Ghana, or they could stay in the account and earn interest. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to fall within a range of $0.035 and $0.055 cents per kilowatt-hour (kW/h). According to the World Bank, the average electricity tariff in Africa is much higher — at $0.13 per kW/h.5. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Bui Dam Construction Project as December 2, 2013. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 25, 2007 and September 1, 2012, respectively. The Gh-DCMIS identifies the official completion date for the Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project as December 31, 2017. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates, according to the Gh-DCMIS, were November 29, 2013 and December 2, 2013, respectively.6.

This issue warrants further investigation.8. Some sources suggest that an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 1.075%  applied to the BCL from China Eximbank. This issue warrants further investigation.9.  The (principal) amounts outstanding for 2020 and 2021 are drawn from the Ghanaian Ministry of Finance’s Annual Public Debt Reports.

The (principal) amounts outstanding for 2018 and 2019 are drawn from the 2019 Annual Report of Rui Power Authority. 10. According to a 2011 study published by Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik, '[t]he financial arrangement is secured by cocoa as collateral. [...] [T]he Chinese government guaranteed to purchase 30,000 tonnes of cocoa per year from the Ghanaian government at going world market prices – rather than a fixed price – until the dam was operational. The reason for this is that China wants to promote cocoa consumption in China. Until the Bui Dam becomes operational and begins generating revenue to service the loan (during the construction period there is a moratorium on the payment of the principal, which means that only interest has to be paid in that period), the proceeds from the sale of cocoa are placed in an escrow account, i. e. a trust account, held by the China Exim Bank as security for loan repayments. If not all the funds in the escrow account are needed to pay the interest, then the excess reverts to the Ghanaian government, i. e. the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Once the dam is operational within five years of the signing of the loan agreement, the cocoa agreement lapses. By that time, the interviewee hoped, China will have developed a taste for cocoa and so become a new and important market for Ghanaian cocoa. When the Bui Dam is operational and the cocoa agreement expires, 85 per cent of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the completed Bui Dam will be placed in an escrow account held by China Exim Bank to service the debt. The remaining 15 per cent will be used to meet the Bui Power Authority’s administration costs. If not all the 85 per cent is needed for debt servicing, the excess will revert to the Government of Ghana, i. e. the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning and the Central Bank. If Ghana decides not to withdraw the excess money from the escrow account, it will earn interest.' See https://www.idos-research.de/uploads/media/DP_3.2001.pdf",True,0.86989367

This GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 6 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee (or service charge).   The purpose of the project was to construct the the Ivato International Conference Center (ICC), a five-star hotel, and 54 luxury villas in Antananarivo (near the Ivato International Airport). The Ivato International Conference Center was originally supposed to be funded by a Chinese Government grant (see Project ID#72750), but it and the 5-star hotel were later fused into one project so that the grant element for the hotel loan would be sufficiently concessional to meet IMF standards.  The Golden Peacock Five-Star Hotel has more than 200 rooms, including 2 presidential suites. The ICC can accommodate 1,000 people and has an area of ​​9,141 square meters and includes a conference hall, a news center, a VIP restaurant, and related facilities. The ultimate purpose of this project was to promote tourism and international conferences in Madagascar. The 54 villas sit on an area of about 23,000 square meters.    Anhui Urban and Rural Planning and Design Institute was responsible for the design of the project and Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group Co., Ltd. was responsible for the implementation of the project. Project implementation officially commenced on December 2, 2007.

The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 19.5-year repayment period, a 4% interest rate, and an unknown grace period.   The proceeds of the BCL were used to partially finance the $1.154 billion commercial contract signed on February 28, 2007 with China Railway Engineering Group Co. Ltd. and China Railway Erju Co. Ltd. Unit Transtech Engineering Corporation.  The project involved constructing a 762 km railway line from Port Sudan to Khartoum via Atbara. It also involved the provision of electric multiple units (EMUs) from CSR Ziyang Locomotive Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Electric Company.   A groundbreaking ceremony for the Atbara to Port Sudan portion of the railway was held on February 20, 2013, and a formal project handover ceremony for the Khartoum to Atbara portion of the railway was held on January 20, 2014.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the Khartoum-Port Sudan Railway Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. In August 2010, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Sudan reported that the project had been stagnant due to the Government of Sudan's inability to make loan repayments. Then, according to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421).

This project had two components: the National Data Transmission Infrastructure (NBI) and the e-Government Infrastructure (EGI). The purpose of NBI was to connect all districts to National Backbone Infrastructure through the laying of fiber optic cable to all major towns and the use of alternative technologies like wireless technologies to cover to the rest of the country, and to provide low cost bandwidth throughout the country through the building of the NBI.   The purpose of EGI was to connect all government ministries and some government departments into an e-government network and to provide services like videoconferencing, data and voice communication. It involved the establishment of a Primary Data Centre for Government at Statistics House; the establishment of the Network Operations Centre in Statistics House that will monitor the entire infrastructure; and an effort to connect all government ministries and some government departments through the laying of fiber optic cable onto the e-Government Network. Huawei was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 of the project involved the laying of 168 km of fiber optic cable to connect the towns of Mukono, Bombo, Entebbe and Jinja to Kampala. Phase 1 also achieved the following: (1) laying of the fiber optic cable within Kampala and Entebbe to link 27 Ministries and Government Departments; (2) delivery and installation of communication equipment to the 27 Ministries and Departments that will form the E-Government network; and (3) Video conferencing services deployed to all the Ministries and Government Departments. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation.   Phase 1 was completed in June 2008. It suffered from higher-than-expected costs and was plagued by accusations of fraud (by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.).

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.

Sinohydro was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract supporting the project was originally scheduled to begin on August 15, 2007. According to Sinohydro, construction began in August 2007. However, construction of the Angola Lunda Norte Province Secondary School reportedly did not commence until August 15, 2012. 1.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In February 2006, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $66,898,156.50 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Next Generation Network (NGN) Project in Bengo, Bie, Kwanza-Norte, Kwanza-Sul, Luanda, Malange, and Moxico Provinces.  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $74,331,285.00 commercial (EPC) contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on February 13, 2006.  The NGN Project sought to build/install a 3,459 km fiber optic network using next generation technologies in 141 localities within the following 14 provinces: Bengo, Bie, Kwanza Norte, Kwanza Sul, Luanda, Malange, Moxico, Huambo, Huila, Cunene, Uige, Zaire, Benguela and Cabinda.  CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract supporting the Next Generation Network (NGN) Project in Bengo, Bie, Kwanza-Norte, Kwanza-Sul, Luanda, Malange, and Moxico Provinces went into effect on October 24, 2006 and the originally expected project handover date was April 8, 2009.

1043,"China Eximbank provides RMB 154.8 million government concessional loan for Phase 1 of Kenya Power Distribution System Modernization Project (Linked to Project ID#16392, #58359, 92446) In August 2005, the Chinese Government and the Government of Kenya signed a preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Kenya Power Distribution System Modernization and Strengthening Project. Then, on January 23, 2006, China Eximbank signed an RMB 161,028,810 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK No GCL 2006(02)(144)] with the Government of Kenya for Phase 1 of the Kenya Power Distribution System Modernization and Strengthening Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 154,835,394.23. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 6.75-year grace period, and a 20.25-year maturity (final maturity date: March 21, 2026). The borrower was expected to make semi-annual repayments to the lender between September 23, 2012 and March 21, 2026.   The Government of Kenya, in turn, on-lent the proceeds of the loan to a Kenyan state-owned enterprise called Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) at a 2.5% interest rate. KPLC later signed a novation agreement, which transferred ownership of the project and loan repayment responsibility to another Kenyan state-owned enterprise called Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO).   The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 6,193,415.70 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and RMB 12,386,831.54 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022. The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 74,320.989.16 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 61,934,157.62 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 49,547,326.08 as of June 30, 2022. The Government of Kenya’s External Public Debt Register suggests that this loan was rescheduled in early 2021.   The purpose of the project was to construct (1) a 61km, 132kV transmission line from the Chemosit to Kisii substations and (2) a 122km, 132kV transmission line from Meru to Embu -- which then connects all the way to the Kamburu hydropower station (see Project ID#58707).   China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd. (CAMCE) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Works were originally expected to begin in July 2006 and end in July 2008. However, works actually began in July 2007 and were officially completed on November 24, 2010.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loan for Phase 1 of the Kenya Power Distribution System Modernization Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On March 21, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a debt suspension agreement (captured via Project ID#92446). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due during the March 21, 2021-June 30, 2021 period under two government concessional loan (GCL) agreements with outstanding balances: the loan for Phase 1 of the Kenya Power Distribution System Modernization and Strengthening Project and the loan for the Rural Telecommunication Development Project. 1. This project is also known as the Chemositsit-Kisii-Meru Power Distribution Project and the Chinese project title is 肯尼亚城网改造项目一期工. 2. Some sources suggest that the Government of Kenya issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank loan. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. According to Kenya Electronic Project Management Information System (e-ProMIS), the Chinese Government issued another $41,182,400 loan for the Kenya Power Distribution System Modernization Project in February 2012 (see Project ID#58359). However, it is unclear if this commitment was ever finalized and if it provided supplemental funding for the project’s first phase (captured via Project ID#1043) or second phase (captured via Project ID#16392). The project identification and reference numbers in the Kenya Electronic Project Management Information System (e-ProMIS) are 2012/053905 and KPLC010, respectively. 4.

12985,"MOFCOM provides an RMB 30 million interest-free loan for the Douiret Dam and Ksar Ouled Debbab Dam Construction Project In 2006, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) issued a RMB 30 million interest-free loan to the Government of Tunisia for the Douiret Dam and Ksar Ouled Debbab Dam Construction Project. The loan proceeds were drawn from one or more Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCAs) that the Chinese Government and the Government of Tunisia previously signed. However, it is not known which specific ETCA(s) were utilized.  The project involved the construction of two mountainous dams — with total water storage capacity of 890,000 cubic meters — in the villages of Ksar Ouled Debbab (قصر أولاد دباب) and Douiret (دويرات) within the Tataouine Governorate (in the southern part of the country, close to the Sahara Desert). It also involved the construction of spillways and the water diversion pipelines. The Douiret Dam was a homogeneous earth dam. Its crest had an elevation of 426 meters and a width of 5 meters, while the dam had a length of 578.79 meters. The maximum dam height was 12 meters. The Ksar Ouled Debbab Dam included a roller compacted concrete dam, a spillway, and vent pipe. The maximum height of the dam was 12 meters, and the dam crest was 5 meters wide. The construction of dams were expected to nourish the underground water tables, protect the city of Tataouine and the surrounding area from floods, control runoff water, and develop vegetation and Tunisia's agriculture by reducing the effects of drought.  Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Group Co., Ltd. (Chinese company name: 江西省水利水电建设有限公司) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Tunisia's Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources supervised the project implementation.  The project was originally expected to begin implementation during the first half of 2007. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 20, 2008. The construction period was two years and the project was expected to be completed in April 2010.  In December 2009, MOFCOM conducted a final project inspection on the nearly-complete Douiret Dam and still-under-construction Ksar Ouled Debbab Dam. The project was ultimately completed; however, its exact date of completion is unknown. 1.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, carried the following borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $41,006,416.61 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Huambo and Bié Agricultural School Construction Project. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $45,562,685.12 commercial contract with Sinohydro, which was signed on March 4, 2005.   Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029).

Project ID#34773 captures the first, $41 million China Eximbank loan that supported this project.   Project ID#34795 captures the second, $26.55 million China Eximbank loan for agricultural schools in Huambo and Bié.  The purpose of the project, which employed 98 Angolan workers and 41 Chinese workers, was to construct two agriculture schools: one in Ndango, Caála within Huambo Province and one in Andulo within Bié Province. The Huambo Medium Agrarian Institute has three two-story buildings each, which serve as dormitories, classrooms, and an administrative area.  There are 15 residences for teachers, a cafeteria with the capacity for 150 people, a health centre, gymnasium, laboratories, a laundry, and kitchen, apart from areas of leisure and soccer fields.  Outside the facility there are 30 hectares of land for practical lessons for students.  The facilities are designed to accommodate 262 students.  The facility has 22 classrooms.  Overall, the school occupies over 10,000 square meters of land.  In the Medium Agrarian Institute (Instituto Medio Agrario) of Bié, there are two classrooms for 50 students, an amphitheater for 30 students, a small classroom for language teaching, and a computer and laboratory room.  There are also three offices, a library and a warehouse. In the classrooms there are chairs, benches, chairs and tables.  Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  Then, in March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $53,044,838.28 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Luanda and Benguela Technical School Construction Project. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $58,938,709.20 commercial contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 10, 2005.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In October 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $7,206,258.60 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Kwanza-Norte Health Center Construction and Equipping Project.  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $8.006,954.00 commercial (EPC) contract with CAMCO, which was signed on October 29, 2005.  The purpose of the project, which employed 62 Angolan workers and 47 Chinese workers, was the construction and equipping of two health centers in Kwanza-Norte Province: one in the town of Dondo and the other in the town of Ndalatando (N'dalatando).  CAMCO was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract for the construction of the two health centers had two scheduled start dates: October 10, 2006, and October 25, 2006.  The originally expected projected handover dates were October 10, 2007, and September 25, 2007, respectively.  An inauguration ceremony for the health center was held on April 6, 2010, but it is unclear when construction commenced and concluded. 1. In the appendix to her book, Dr. Lucy Corkin identified two health centers built in Kwanza-Norte and Kwanza-Sul Province; however, documents published by Angola's Ministry of Finance indicate that the two health centers were both located in Kwanza-Norte Province.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.   In March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $26,266,949.10 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Malanje Hospital Rehabilitation and Equipping Project.  The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $29,185,499.00 commercial (EPC) contract between Sinohydro and the Angola Ministry of Health, which was signed on March 9, 2005.  The purpose of the project, which employed 49 Angolan workers and 33 Chinese workers, was to rehabilitate a 175-bed hospital in Caculama City within Malanje (Malange) Province. The seven-story building covers an area of 54.4 thousand square meters, with areas for visits, hospitalizations, surgeries, mortuary, maternity, administrative services, dining and laundry.  The hospital also has an oxygen plant, incinerator, area for generators, new water networks, sanitation, electricity and mechanics.  Among its specialties are ophthalmology and dentistry. Through this project, the hospital was to be outfitted with X-ray rooms, clinical laboratories, ultrasound equipment and electrocardiogram equipment.  Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The contract for this project was originally scheduled to go into effect on March 9, 2006 and the originally scheduled handover date was December 9, 2007.

In October 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $43,254,389.19 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Lubango Regional Hospital Construction and Equipping Project.  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $48,060,432.43 commercial contract between Sinohydro and Angola's Ministry of Health, which was signed on October 25, 2005.   The purpose of this project, which employed 127 Angolan workers and 168 Chinese workers, was the construction and equipping of a regional hospital (with two buildings, one with seven floors and another with two floors) in the city of Lubango (known as António Agostinho Neto Hospital, Hospital Dr. Agostinho Neto, and Hospital Universitário do Lubango).  Upon completion, it was expected that the hospital would benefit over three million inhabitants of Huíla province and others from the neighbouring provinces, namely Namibe, Cunene, Kuando Kubango, Benguela and Huambo.  Sinohydro was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract supporting the project went into effect on July 10, 2006 and the originally project handover date was January 10, 2008. The project officially commenced on May 17, 2006 and ended on June 30, 2008.  The hospital was officially inaugurated on August 29, 2008.  The Lubango Regional Hospital Construction and Equipping Project also received additional funding in September 2007 through a $500 million credit line extension from China Eximbank (as captured via Project ID#34030). 1.

The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.

The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $25,423,762.50 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the 220Kv Capanda-Lucala-N'dalatando Transmission Line Construction Project.  The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $28,248,625.00 commercial (EPC) contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 10, 2005.    The purpose of the project was to construct a 220Kv electricity transmission line from Capanda to N’dalatando via Lucala.  CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract for the project was originally scheduled to go into effect on November 8, 2005 and the originally scheduled handover date was July 31, 2007. The project was ultimately completed at the end of July 2007. 1. The Portuguese project title is Projecto de Construção da LT 220 kV Capanda-Lucala-Ndalatando.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In February 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $190,515,690.59 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project.  The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $211,684,100.65 commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on February 8, 2005.  This project also received a supplementary $50,702,850.00 loan from China Eximbank through a $500 million MLFA (as captured via Project ID#34030) extended to the Government of Angola on July 19, 2007.  This subsidiary loan carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a supplementary commercial contract with CRBC worth $56,336,500.00.    Project ID#34853 captures the first loan, and Project ID#66 captures the second, supplementary loan.  The purpose of this project, which employed 1336 Angolan workers and 367 Chinese workers, was the rehabilitation of a 357 km highway between Quifangondo and Negage via Caxito and Uige. The starting point of the road is in the town of Kifangondo, a northern suburb of Luanda City.  It extends northward through the city of Caxito, the capital of Bengo Province and the city of Uige, the capital of Uige Province.  The road terminates in the city of Negage, an important agricultural town within Uige Province.  CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract supporting the project went into effect on December 13, 2005 and the originally expected project handover date was June 30, 2008.  The project officially commenced on December 13, 2005 and a project handover ceremony took place on August 30, 2008.  The project was later inspected on March 8, 2014 by Chinese MOFCOM (ECCO) officials. 1.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.

Following further negotiations, the number of schools was decreased to 28, and the project will be carried out in 3 phases. Sinomach report the contract cost as 240 million RMB.   The first phase included the construction of 10 schools and the rehabilitation of 1 agricultural institute in the provinces of Luanda, Malanje and Benguela. Of the 10 schools, 6 are institutes of technology, 4 are secondary schools. The first phase also included the supply of equipment and furniture to the schools, including sports facilities to the schools' gyms.

It carried the following terms: a 17-year maturity, 5-year grace period, a 0.2% interest rate, and a 0.25% default (penalty) interest rate. The borrower was originally expected to make 24 semi-annual repayments between 2011 and 2022. The proceeds of the supplier’s credit were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of its $648,832,000 commercial contract with CMEC. The Republic of Congo agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($97,325,000) itself.   Over the lifetime of the supplier’s credit, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay $557,849,330.50 in principal and interest. Then, on January 18, 2006, the supplier’s credit agreement was modified (in particular, Articles 6, 8 and 13). The project execution period was reduced from 5 years to 3.5 years and additional changes were introduced related to the name of the lender; the credit conditions; loan repayment and amortization table; the duration, validity and termination of the credit; and the conditions of entry into force of the credit.   Then, on April 13, 2018, CMEC and the Republic of Congo signed another supplier’s credit agreement modification to reschedule the repayment terms. The parties agreed that the outstanding balance of the loan ($348,614,050) would be repaid according to the following repayment terms: 22-year maturity, a 0.2% interest rate, and 14 semi-annual installments between June 2021 and December 2027. As such, the rescheduling agreement effectively increased the grace period of the supplier’s credit by an additional 3 years (from June 2018 to June 2021). As of April 13, 2018, the borrower had already repaid $207,876,503.54. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $348,614,050 as of June 1, 2018.  Under the terms of the rescheduling agreement, the borrower was responsible for making a $25,249,617 repayment (24,901,003 in principal and $348,614 in interest) on June 1, 2021 and a $25,224,716 repayment  ($24,901,003 in principal and $323,713 in interest)on December 1, 2021. However, according to the Republic of Congo's Ministry of Finance, neither of these repayments were made. By the end of calendar year 2021, the Republic of Congo had approximately $50 million of principal and interest arrears to CMEC.  This project sought to build upon the CMEC-financed 120MW Imboulou Hydropower Plant Project (captured in Project ID#434). It involved connecting the Imboulou Hydropower Plant with several small power stations to construct a “major power channel” (or “energy boulevard”) between the cities of Pointe-Noire, Brazzaville and Ouesso. More specifically, it supported the construction of a load dispatching center (“redistribution center”); the construction and rehabilitation of 220kv transmission lines and very high voltage transformer plants between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire (passing through Mindouli and Loudima); the construction of seven 220 KV and 110 KV high-voltage power stations in Djiri, Ngo, Gamboma, Oyo, Boundji, Owando and Djambala (including a 220kV Imboulou-Ngo segment, a 220kV Ngo-Brazzaville segment; a 220kV Ngo-Gamboma segment, a 220kV Oyo-Owando segment, and a 110kV Ngo-Djambala-Oyo-Boundji segment); the construction of underground 220kV transmission line in Tsiélampo; the construction of nine 30kV aerial lines measuring 242 km in length (including an Imboulou-Inoni-Mpoumako-Imvouba segment, an Inoni-Inoni2-Mbouambé-Léfini segment, an Imboulou-Mbé-Ngabé segment, and an Imboulou-Mpouya segment); the construction of four 20kV underground transmission lines of 20kV to evacuate power from the Imboulou Hydroelectric Power Plant to the capital city of Brazzaville; and the construction of nine additional 220 kV and 110 kV high voltage lines (measuring 841 km in length). In total, the project sought to create a 1,588 km national electricity transmission network.   CMEC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A project start order was issued on June 25, 2008. However, construction did not begin until May 28, 2009. The originally anticipated project completion date was December 31, 2011.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, carried the following borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  On August 9, 2004, the Government of Angola signed a commercial contract worth $13,840,468.00 with an unidentified firm for a Bus Transport Project. China Eximbank issued a subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement to support this project.  AidData assumes that the face value of the loan was equivalent to 90% of the value of the commercial contract ($12,456,421) since other subsidiary loans under the MLFA supported 90% of commercial contract costs.

34786,"China Eximbank provides $20.131 million buyer’s credit loan for Agricultural Equipment, Machinery and Tools Acquisition Project (Linked to Project ID#42029) On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In August 2004, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $20,131,281.00 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Agricultural Equipment, Machinery and Tools Acquisition Project.  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $22,368,090 commercial (EPC) contract with CMEC that was signed on August 11, 2004.  The purpose of the project was to facilitate the acquisition of agricultural equipment, machines and tools for MECANAGRO and Instituto de Desenvolvimento Agrário.  CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract was set to go into effect on September 29, 2005, which may have also been the date when the acquisition was completed.  According to the Angolan Ministry of Finance, this project did reach completion; however, its precise implementation end date is unknown. 1. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it records the face value of the loan for this project as $22 million; however, this value corresponds to the value of the commercial contract rather than the value of the buyer’s credit, which financed 90% of the value of the commercial contract. AidData relies on the face value of the loan ($20,131,281) reported in Dr. Lucy Corkin’s book ('UNCOVERING AGENCY: ANGOLA’S MANAGEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA”), which is based on extensive fieldwork and interviews with Angolan Government officials.2. This project is distinct from Project ID#34785, which captures another China Eximbank loan that facilitated the acquisition of agricultural equipment for MECANAGRO.3. The 2003 framework agreement (中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议) specified that Sinosure would be signing relevant agreements with the Government of Angola. Therefore, AidData has coded Sinosure as an accountable agency and as providing insurance for the loan.  4. AidData considers this loan to be collateralized in a de facto sense.

borrowings approved through MLFA and projects financed through the MLFA were plagued by corruption. Dai Chunning, a China Eximbank official, was convicted in 2017, more than a year and a half after he first stood trial behind closed doors, on corruption charges including taking bribes. He denied some of the allegations against him and later lost an appeal against his conviction. He received a suspended death sentence, which—in line with usual practice in China for such a penalty—was commuted to life imprisonment in 2020. Prosecutors said that Dai Chunning, acting by himself or with associates, solicited or took bribes worth more than RMB 200 million, and attempted to defraud the state of some $19 million in assets, according to court documents. Leung Ping, a well-connected businessman, told Chinese investigators that he, at Dai Chunning’s behest, teamed up with a Hong Kong businessman named Yu Tai Wai (who at the time represented the Angolan Government in talks to secure infrastructure loans from China) to broker Chinese infrastructure projects in Angola and help everyone involved 'make money together.' Leung Ping said Yu Tai Wai represented Angolan parties in talks to negotiate Chinese loans (through the MLFA) and consulting fees for the projects. Dai Chunning and his associates would take these fees as kickbacks for themselves and use a portion of them to pay bribes to Angolan officials, according to Leung Ping's our testimony.  There are also some indications that the Government of Angola's borrowings under the March 2004 MLFA have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. As a result of the Government of Angola’s decision to avail itself of the G20's Debt Service Sustainability Initiative (DSSI), the MLFA and ILAs entered into by China Eximbank and the Government of Angola (described above) were under DSSI treatment and payments due by the Government of Angola under these finance agreements were suspended from May 1, 2020 until December 31, 2021. 1.

Then, on April 8, 2004, the Tunisian Parliament passed a law, approving the interest-free loan. In addition to the Chinese Government, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development provided a $28 million loan for this project in 2000. The primary purpose of this project was to construct a dam on the Kébir River near the town of Tabarka (Dabarka) within the Gafsa Governorate  (ولاية قفصة‎) to address irrigation and residential water shortages in the region. It consisted of 3 components: the construction of a clay core rockfill dam (with water storage capacity of 64 million cubic meters), the construction of a spillway tunnel, and the construction of a water pipeline. The dam was designed to be 70 meters high and 10 meters wide. Its crest was designed to be 560 meters long. Upon completion, the dam was designed to transport 35 million cubic meters of water per year to the Sidi Barrak Reservoir and reduce the risk of flooding within the Gafsa Governorate.

178,"China Eximbank provides $608 million loan for 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#695, #56927, #56959) In October 2002, a joint venture called CCMD Corporation, which is between China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) and China Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation (CWHEC or Sinohydro), applied to China Eximbank for a loan guarantee before bidding on the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project in Sudan. On May 20, 2003, this Chinese consortium ended up winning three different contracts for this project:  (1) a $600 million (EUR 550 million) contract signed on June 7, 2003 for construction of the dam;  (2) a $60 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for auxiliary projects related to the metal frame and hydraulic mechanics; and (3) a $400 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for construction of substations and transmission lines. (Note: A $381.5 million loan for this project component is captured via Project ID#695).   On December 23, 2003, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed three different loan agreements worth a total of $519 million in order to partially finance the first two contracts:  (1) a $400 million loan; (2) a $65 million loan; and (3) a $54 million loan. These loans carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a grace period between 6 and 7 years, and interest rate of 3-4%. China Eximbank later increased its total lending for the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project to $608 million (as captured via Project ID#178).   The total project cost is unclear but estimates range from $1 billion to $3 billion. Therefore, several other entities served as co-financiers. The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project was co-financed with:  (1) $250 million from Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (and possibly an additional $211 million) (2) $150 million from the Kuwait Development Fund (and possibly an additional $50 million) (3) $150 million from the Abu Dhabi Foundation (4) $200 million from the Saudi Fund for Development (5) $15 million from the Government of Qatar (6) $106 million from the Government of Oman  (7) $575 million from the Government of Sudan  The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project involved the construction of a 9.7-kilometer-long and 65-meter-high dam with a total installed capacity of 1250 MW and a storage capacity at 12.4 billion cubic meters. It is located near Merowe Town in northern Sudan, about 350 kilometers (220 mi) north of the capital Khartoum. The project had 8 main components:  (1) Dam: This component included the construction of concrete and embankment sections of the dam on the Nile River channel. The dam crest was to be 9.7 km long and 10 m wide, and its height 60 m above river bed. The dam was also to include the appurtenant structures such as spillway, water intakes and sediment sluices, as well as a hydropower station.  (2) Preparatory Works: This component included the construction of housing facilities for construction supervision and operations personnel, the construction of 27 km access roads from Karima to the dam site, and a loading platform and storage areas at the nearby railway station. (3) Civil Works: This component included excavation, fill, drilling and grouting works, and concrete works for the dam and its appurtenant structures. It also included all civil works for the hydropower station, as well as all necessary instrumentation and monitoring equipment for the operation of the dam. (4) Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, pipes and related mechanical equipment for the dam and its appurtenant structures. (5) Hydro-Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, penstocks, cranes and related hydro-mechanical equipment necessary for the control of water, and operation and maintenance of the dam and its appurtenant structures. (6) Electromechanical and Electrical Works for the Power Station: This component included the furnishing and installation of ten turbines, each rated at 125 MW, and ten 150 MVA generators. It also included the construction of 500 and 220 kV switchyards, and the supply of the necessary transformers and bus bars, as well as control, protection and monitoring systems. (7) Transmission Lines: This component included the construction of 500 and 220 kV overhead lines having a total length of 1700 km, as well as seven sub-stations. (8) Consultancy Services: This component included the consultancy services required to review the conceptual design, prepare the detailed design, and construction supervision.  The project owner was Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources’ Merowe Dam Implementation Unit. The contractors responsible for implementation included China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), Sinohydro, Harbin Power Engineering Company (HPEC), and Alstom, a French company.   The originally anticipated project commencement and completion dates were July 30, 2005 and July 30, 2008, respectively. The project began construction on July 8, 2003, and the first two generators were officially connected to the national grid on March 3, 2009. However, it was not until April 8, 2010 that the tenth unit of the Merowe dam was officially connected to the grid. However; issues with silt and debris accumulation threaten the long-term life of the dam. By 2020, the dam had lost 1.7% of its holding capacity.  According to a 2015 book (entitled ""Water, Civilisation and Power in Sudan"") by Harry Verhoeven, Dr. Sabir Mohamed Hassan (the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan) has ""described one of the reasons for prioritising Merowe as 'the government needed something big to show to the people'. It was no coincidence that Omar Al-Bashir campaigned for the Sudanese presidency in April 2010 with a picture of himself in front of the Merowe Dam, the symbol of civilisation delivered by Al-Ingaz, as his main electoral poster.""  The project was awarded the Luban Prize, a master prize in the PRC for development projects. However, it was also plagued by controversy.  The project participants were required to prepare or contract an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in accordance with specific guidelines that address three major topics:  (1) Social issues -- consequences of people resettlement from future flooded area;  and (2) Archeological issues -- resulting from destruction or submerging important archeological sites or places of high cultural value; and (3) Environmental issues -- effect of large scale hydrological alteration of the natural river system with major impacts on the environment and water quality.   In April 2002, Lahmeyer International prepared the EIA report for the Merowe Dam Project. The report focused on complex resettlement issues involving about 7500 families. Among the environmental impacts it discussed were the hydrological changes, the erosion of the river bed and its banks, greenhouse gas emissions, and changes in the aquatic ecosystem. The 150 page report was far from meeting European or international standards, such as the guidelines of the World Commission on Dams. No serious attempt was made to use the vast scientific knowledge base on environmental effects of large dams, although four decades of research on the Aswan High Dam (Lake Nasser in Egypt, Lake Nubia in Sudan) had revealed a dramatic sediment accumulation in the upper part of the reservoir, problematic water quality issues and detrimental downstream effects such as river bed erosion or water level fluctuations. An estimated 60,000 civilians were ultimately displaced during the construction of the dam. Sudanese civilians protested the project’s execution from the start, and in a confrontation with authorities in April 2006, five people from a displaced community were killed.  There are also some indications that the loans that were issued for the construction of the Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.  1.

SAIS-CARI's Chinese Loans to Africa Database claims that this project was financed with an export buyer's credit. However, according to an official source (http://www.tjjh.gov.cn/xyjh/xydt/gjdt/202008/t20200819_3490848.html), the project was financed with an export seller’s credit. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. AidData relies on the borrowing terms that are reported by the Government of Sudan. 4. According to an official source (http://www.tjjh.gov.cn/xyjh/xydt/gjdt/202008/t20200819_3490848.html), the borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure.5.  Although China Eximbank increased its total lending for the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project to $608 million, it is unclear if the additional $89 million was provided through a separate loan agreement or an amendment to an existing loan agreement.  This issue warrants further investigation. The joint venture between CWE and Sinohydro won four different contracts: 2A, 2B, 2C, and 3D worth a total of EUR 603 million (RMB 6 billion). Contracts 2A-C were probably signed in 2003 (described in first paragraph of the project description) and contract 3D (unknown) likely explains the increase in financing from China Eximbank.6.
